<h2><a id="Preface1">Preface</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Vevay</span>, from which “The Last of the Flatboats” starts on its voyage down
  the Mississippi, is a beautiful little Indiana town on the Ohio River,
  about midway between Cincinnati and Louisville. The town and Switzerland
  County, of which it is the capital, were settled by a company of energetic
  and thrifty Swiss immigrants, about the year 1805. Their family names are
  still dominant in the town. I recall the following as familiar to me there
  in my boyhood: Grisard, Thiebaud, Le Clerc, Moreraud, Detraz, Tardy, Malin,
  Golay, Courvoisseur, Danglade, Bettens, Minnit, Violet, Dufour, Dumont,
  Duprez, Medary, Schenck, and others of Swiss origin.</p>
<p>The name Thiebaud, used in this story, was always pronounced “Kaybo” in
  Vevay. The name Moreraud was called “Murrow.”</p>
<p>The map which accompanies this volume was specially prepared for it by
  Lieut.-Col. Alexander McKenzie of the Corps of Engineers of the United
  States Army. To his skill, learning, and courtesy I and my readers are
  indebted for the careful marking of the practically navigable parts of
  the great river system, and for the calculation of mileage in every case.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RESCUE OF THE PIGS</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Give</span> it up, boys; you’re tired, and you’ve
  been in the water too long already. And, besides, I’ve decided that this
  job’s done.”</p>
<p>It was Ed Lowry who spoke. He was lying on the sand under a big sycamore
  tree that had slid, roots and all, off the river bank above, and now stood
  leaning like a drunken man trying to stand upright.</p>
<p>Ed was a tall, slender, and not at all robust boy, with a big head, and
  a tremendous shock of half-curly hair to make it look bigger.</p>
<p>The four boys whom he addressed had been diving in the river and struggling
  with something under the water, but without success. Three of them accepted
  Ed’s suggestion, as all of them were accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> do,
  not because he had any particular right to make suggestions to them, but
  because he was so far the moral and intellectual superior of every boy
  in town, and was always so wise and kindly and just in his decisions, that
  they had come to regard his word as a sort of law without themselves quite
  knowing why.</p>
<p>Three of the boys left the river, therefore, shook the water off their
  sunburned bodies,—for they had no towels,—and slipped into the loose shirt
  and cottonade trousers that constituted their sole costume.</p>
<p>The other boy—Ed’s younger brother, Philip—was not so ready to accept
  suggestions. In response to Ed’s call, he cried out in a sort of mock heroics:—</p>
<p>“Never say die! In the words of the immortal Lawrence, or some other immortal
  who died a long time ago, ‘Don’t give up the ship!’ <i>I’m</i> going to
  get that pig if it takes all summer.”</p>
<p>The boys all laughed as they threw themselves down upon the sand by Ed.</p>
<p>“Might as well let him alone,” said Will Moreraud; “he never will quit.”</p>
<p>Meantime Phil had dived three or four times more, each time going down
  head first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> wrestling
  with the object as long as he could hold his breath, and each time manifestly
  moving one end or the other of it nearer the shore, and into shallower
  water, before coming to the surface again.</p>
<p>When he had caught his breath after the third or fourth struggle, he called
  out:—</p>
<p>“I say, boys, it isn’t a pig at all, but a good average-sized elephant.
  ‘Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish,’ <i>I’m</i> going to get
  that animal ashore.”</p>
<p>“He’ll do it, too,” said Constant Thiebaud.</p>
<p>“Of course he will,” drawled Irving Strong. “It’s a way he has. He never
  gives up anything. Don’t you remember how he stuck to that sum in the arithmetic
  about that cistern whose idiotic builder had put three different sized
  pipes to run water into it, and two others of still different sizes to
  run water out? He worked three weeks over that thing after all the rest
  of us gave it up and got Mrs. Dupont to show us—and he got it, too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and he can do it now backwards or forwards or standing on his head,”
  said Constant Thiebaud; “while there isn’t another boy here that can do
  it at all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>“Except Ed Lowry,” said Irving Strong. “But then, he’s different, and
  knows a whole lot about the higher mathematics, while we’re only in algebra.
  How is it, Ed? You’ve been sick so much that I don’t believe you ever did
  go to school more than a month at a time, and yet you’re ahead of all of
  us.”</p>
<p>Just then Phil came up after a long tussle under the water, and this time
  stood only a little way from shore where the water was not more than breast
  high. He cried:—</p>
<p>“Now I’ve ‘met the enemy and it’s ours,’ or words to that effect. I’ve
  got the elephant into three feet of water, but I can’t ‘personally conduct’
  it ashore. Come here, all of you, and help.”</p>
<p>The boys quickly dropped out of their clothes, and went to their comrade’s
  assistance.</p>
<p>“What is the thing, anyhow?” asked Irving Strong.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Phil. “All I know is that it’s got elbows and wrists
  and all sorts of burs on it, on which I’ve been skinning my shins for the
  last half hour; and that it is heavier than one of your compositions, Irv.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The thing was in water so shallow that all the boys at once could get
  at it merely by bending forward and plunging their heads and shoulders
  under the surface. But it was so unwieldy that it took all five of them—for
  Ed too had joined, as he always did when there was need of him—fully ten
  minutes to bring it out upon shore.</p>
<p>“I say, boys,” said Ed, “this is a big find. It’s that ferry-boat shaft
  the iron man told us about, and you remember we are to have fifty dollars
  for it.”</p>
<p>“Then hurrah for Phil Lowry’s obstinate pertinacity!” said Irving Strong.
  “That’s what Mrs. Dupont called it when she bracketed his name and mine
  together on the bulletin-board as ‘Irreclaimable whisperers.’ Phil, you
  may be irreclaimable, but you’ve proved that this shaft isn’t.”</p>
<p>It was just below the little old town of Vevay on the Ohio River, where
  Swiss names and some few Swiss customs still survived long after the Swiss
  settlers of 1805 were buried. To be exact, it was at “The Point,” where
  all Vevay boys went for their swimming because it lay a little beyond the
  town limits, and so Joe Peelman, the marshal, could not arrest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> them
  for swimming there in daylight without their clothes.</p>
<p>During the high water of the preceding winter a barge loaded with pig-iron
  had broken in two there and sunk. The strong current quickly carried away
  what was left of the wrecked barge,—which had been scarcely more than a
  great oblong box,—leaving the iron to be undermined by the water and to
  sink into the sand and gravel of the bottom.</p>
<p>The agent who came to look after matters quickly decided that at such
  a place very little of the cargo could ever be recovered—not enough to
  justify him in sending a wrecking force there. He thought, too, that by
  the time of summer low water—for the Ohio runs very low indeed in July
  and August—the iron would have settled and scattered too much to be worth
  searching for.</p>
<p>But Phil Lowry not only never liked to give up, he never liked to see
  anybody else give up. So what he looked upon as the iron man’s weak surrender
  gave him an idea. He said to the agent:—</p>
<p>“That iron’s where we boys go swimming in summer-time. If we get any of
  it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> out
  during the low water, can we have it? Is it ‘finder’s keeper’?”</p>
<p>“Well, no,” said the man, hesitating. “But I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
  If you boys get out any considerable quantity,—say fifty tons or more,—enough
  to justify me in sending a steamboat after it, I’ll pay you three dollars
  a ton salvage for it.”</p>
<p>So the boys formed a salvage copartnership. Long-headed Ed Lowry, in order
  to avoid misunderstandings, drew up an agreement, and the iron man signed
  it. It gave the boys entire charge of the wreck, and bound the owner to
  pay for recovered iron as he had proposed. Just before signing the paper
  the agent remembered the ferry-boat wheel shaft, which had been a part
  of the cargo; and as it was a valuable piece of property, which he particularly
  wanted to recover, he added a clause to the contract agreeing to pay an
  additional fifty dollars for it, if by any remote chance it should be saved.</p>
<p>During the summer the boys had been specially favored by circumstances.
  The river had gone down much earlier that year than usual, and it went
  at last much lower than it had done for many years past. As a consequence
  they had prospered well in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> their
  enterprise. Their pile of iron “pigs” on the shore when the shaft was found
  amounted to three hundred tons, and the agent was to arrive by the packet
  that night to pay for it and take possession. This was, therefore, their
  last day’s work, and thanks to Philip Lowry’s “obstinate pertinacity” it
  was the most profitable day’s work of them all.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW IT ALL BEGAN</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the wheel shaft was tugged ashore, the
  boys slipped on their clothes again and retired to the shade of the big
  sycamore tree, where Ed Lowry had left the book he had been reading. Ed
  Lowry always had a book within reach.</p>
<p>Philip threw himself down to rest. He was not only tired, he was physically
  “used up” with his labors under water in tugging first one and then the
  other end of the heavy shaft toward the shore.</p>
<p>It would have been very hard work even in the open air. Under water, and
  without breath, it had completely exhausted the boy. Just now he was bent
  upon sleep. So in spite of the sun glare, and in spite of the chatter around
  him, and still more, in spite of a sense of triumph which was strong enough
  in him to have kept anybody else awake, he fell into a profound slumber.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, we’ve finished the job,” said Constant Thiebaud after a while.
  “What’s the result, Ed?”</p>
<p>Ed Lowry pulled a memorandum out of his pocket and studied it for a while.</p>
<p>“We have saved a trifle over three hundred tons of pig-iron,” he replied,
  “and for that, at $3.00 a ton, will get a little over $900. We’re to get
  $50 more for the shaft, which makes $950. It’ll be a trifle more than that,
  but not enough more to count. My calculation is that we shall have about
  $190 apiece when the agent settles with us to-night—possibly $195.”</p>
<p>“And a mighty good summer’s work it is,” said Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“Especially as it’s been all fun,” said Irv Strong, “to a parcel of amphibious
  Ohio River boys who would have stayed in the water most of the time anyhow.
  It’s better fun diving after pig-iron than after mussel-shells, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Irving was the only boy in the party whose people were comparatively well-to-do,
  and who could therefore afford to think of the fun they had had without
  much concern for the profits. But Irv Strong had no trace of arrogance
  in his make-up. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> could
  have dressed, if he had chosen, in much better fashion than any other boy
  in town. But he chose instead to wear blue cottonade trousers and a tow
  linen shirt, and to go barefoot just as his comrades did. So in speaking
  of the pleasure they had had, he put the matter in a way that all could
  sympathize with. For truly they had had more “fun” as he called it, than
  ever before in their lives. Ed Lowry could have told them why. He could
  have explained to them how much a real purpose, an object worth struggling
  for, adds to the enjoyment people get out of sport; but Ed usually kept
  his philosophy to himself except when there was a need for it. Just now
  there was no need. The boys were as happy as possible in the completion
  of their task, just as they had been as happy as possible in performing
  it. Satisfaction is better than an explanation at any time, and Ed Lowry
  knew it.</p>
<p>There was silence for a considerable time. Perhaps all the boys were tired
  after their hard day’s work. Presently Constant Thiebaud spoke.</p>
<p>“A hundred and ninety dollars apiece! That’s more money than any of us
  ever saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> before.
  I say, boys, what are we going to do with it?”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“Let him speak first who can speak best,” said Irv Strong. “So, Ed Lowry,
  what are you going to do with <i>your</i> share of the money?”</p>
<p>“I’m going shopping with it—shopping for some ‘bargain counter’ health,”
  replied the tall boy.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?” asked two boys at once, and eagerly.</p>
<p>“Well, my phthisic was very bad last winter, you know. It isn’t phthisic
  at all, I think. Phthisic is consumption, and I haven’t that—yet.”</p>
<p>He spoke hopefully, rather than confidently. He hoped his malady might
  not be a fatal one, but sometimes he had doubts.</p>
<p>Let me say here that his hope was better founded than his fear. For at
  this latter end of the century, Ed Lowry—under his own proper name and
  not under that which I am hiding him behind in this story—is not only living,
  but famous. His bodily strength has always been small, but the work he
  has done in the world with that big brain of his has been very great, and
  his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> name—the
  real one I mean—is familiar to everybody who reads books or cares for American
  history.</p>
<p>“But whatever it is,” Ed continued, “the doctor wants me to go South for
  this winter, and now that I’ve got money enough, I’m going to do it.”</p>
<p>“But you haven’t got money enough,” said Irv Strong. “A hundred and ninety
  dollars won’t much more than pay your steamboat fare to New Orleans and
  back. What are you going to live on down there—especially if you get sick?”</p>
<p>The irrepressible Phil selected this as the time to wake up. “Well,” he
  said, sitting up in the sand and locking his muscular arms around his knees,
  “<i>I’m</i> in this game a little bit myself. I’ve got one whole hundred
  and ninety dollars’ worth of stake in that big pile of iron; and from Mrs.
  Dupont down to the last one-suspendered chap in the lot of you, you are
  all always talking about my ‘obstinate pertinacity.’ Well, my ‘pertinacity’
  just now ‘obstinately’ declares that Ed shall take my share in the stake
  and spend it for his health. He shakes his head, but if he won’t, then
  I ‘solemnly swear or affirm’ that I’ll take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> every
  dollar of it out to the channel there and throw it in. I’ll—”</p>
<p>But Phil had broken down. His affection for his half-invalid brother was
  the one thing that nothing could ever overcome. He didn’t weep. That is
  to say, none of the boys saw him shed tears, but instead of finishing the
  sentence he was uttering, he suddenly became interested in the pebbles
  along the river shore, fifty yards lower down the stream.</p>
<p>Ed, too, found it difficult just then to say anything. Ed had always been
  disposed to worry himself about Phil—to regulate him, and when he couldn’t
  do that, to suffer in his own mind and conscience for his brother’s misdeeds—which,
  after all, were usually nothing worse than manifestations of excessive
  boyish enthusiasm, the undue use of slang, and an excessive devotion to
  purposes which Ed’s calmer temper could not quite approve. Just now Ed
  had made a new discovery. He had found out something of the rattling, restless,
  reckless boy’s character which he had never fully known before. For he
  did not know, as the other boys did, how Phil, a year ago, had waited for
  half an hour behind the schoolhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> and
  armed with stones had wreaked a fearful vengeance upon the big bully twice
  his size, who had used his strength cruelly to torment Ed’s weakness. That
  story had been kept from Ed, because it was well understood that he did
  not approve of fighting; and the boys, who fully sympathized with the little
  fellow’s animosity against the big bully, didn’t want him censured for
  his battle and victory.</p>
<p>So there was silence after Phil’s declaration of his purpose, which every
  boy there knew that he would fulfil to the letter. At last Ed said:—</p>
<p>“On my own share of the money I could go by taking deck passage.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” cried Phil, suddenly reappearing in a sort of wrath that was very
  unusual with him—“yes, and live on equal terms with a lot of dirty, low-lived
  wretches—ugh! Now see here, Ed! I’ve told you you are to take my share
  of the money. If you don’t, I’ll do exactly what I said,—I’ll get it changed
  into coin, and I’ll drop it into the river at a point where no diving will
  ever get it. I’ve said my say. I’ll do my do.”</p>
<p>“Look here,” drawled Irv Strong, after a moment. “Let’s <i>all</i> go
  to New Orleans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> and
  don’t let’s pay any steamboat fare at all except to get back!”</p>
<p>“But how?” asked three boys, in a breath.</p>
<p>“Let’s run a flatboat! In my father’s day, pretty nearly all the hay,
  grain, bacon, apples, onions, and the like, grown in this part of the country,
  were sent to New Orleans in flatboats. I don’t see why it wouldn’t pay
  for us to take a flatboat down the river now. We’ve more than enough money
  to build and run her, and we can get a cargo, I’ll bet a brass button.”</p>
<p>The boys were all eagerness. They knew, of course, what a flatboat was,
  but they had seen very few craft of that sort, as the old floating flatboats
  had almost entirely given place on the Ohio to barges, towed, or rather
  pushed, by big, stern-wheel steamboats. For the benefit of readers who
  never saw anything of the kind, let me explain.</p>
<p>A flatboat was simply a big, overgrown, square-bowed and square-sterned
  scow, with a box-like house built on top. She could carry a very heavy
  cargo without sinking below her gunwales, and the house on top, with its
  roof of slightly curved boards, was to hold the cargo. There was a little
  open space at the bow to let freight in and out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> while
  a part of the deck-house at the stern was made into a little box-like cabin
  for the crew. The scow part, or boat proper, was strongly built, with great
  timber gunwales, and a bottom of two-inch plank tightly caulked. The freight-house
  built on it was so put together that only a few of the planks were required
  to have nails in them, so that when the boat reached New Orleans she could
  be sold as lumber for more than she had originally cost.</p>
<p>She was simply floated down the river by the current. There were two big
  oars, or “sweeps,” as they were called, with which the men by rowing could
  give the craft steerage way—that is to say, speed enough to let the big
  steering oar throw her stern around as a rudder does, and guide her course.
  All this was necessary in making sharp turns in the channel to keep off
  bars; but as the flatboats usually went down the river only at high stages
  of water, the chief use of the oars was to make landings.</p>
<p>Ed could have told his comrades some interesting facts concerning the
  enormous part that the flatboats once played in that commerce which built
  up the great Western country; but, as Irv Strong said, there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> “already
  a question before the house. That question is, ‘Why can’t we five fellows
  build a flatboat, load her, and take her down the river?’ We’ll be the
  ‘hands’ ourselves, and won’t charge ourselves any wages, so we can certainly
  carry freight cheaper than any steamboat can. We’ll earn some more money,
  perhaps, and if we don’t, we’ll have lots of fun, and best of all, we’ll
  ‘bust that broncho,’ or bronchitis of Ed’s—for that’s what it is. They
  call it phthisic only because that’s the very hardest word in the book
  to spell.”</p>
<p>The sun was getting low, but the boys were deeply interested. They would
  have determined upon the project then and there but for Ed’s caution. As
  it was, they made him a sort of committee of one to inquire into details,
  to find out what it would cost to build a flatboat, what living expenses
  would be necessary for her boy crew, what it would cost them for passage
  back from New Orleans, and on what terms they could get a cargo.</p>
<p>This is how it all began.</p>
<hr class="divrule" />
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">CAPTAIN PHIL</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ed</span>’s report was in all respects favorable to
  the enterprise. Perry Raymond, who in the old days had built many scores
  of flatboats, was now too old to undertake an active enterprise. But he
  told Ed, to the very last board, how much lumber would be required, and
  the price of every stick in it. He volunteered, as a mere matter of favor
  and without any charge whatever, to superintend and direct the work of
  the boys in building a boat for themselves. The result was that they could
  build a boat for a very small fraction of their money, and Perry promised
  to show them how to caulk it for themselves.</p>
<p>Ed had seen the principal merchants of the place, also. It was their practice
  to exchange goods for country produce—any sort that might come to them,
  whether hay, or onions, or garlic, or butter, or eggs, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> wheat,
  or wool, or corn, or apples, or what not.</p>
<p>It was their business to know pretty accurately how much of each kind
  of produce they were likely to get during any given season in return for
  their goods, and how best to market it. They knew to a nicety how much
  butter and how many eggs or how many bushels of onions or how many pounds
  of hay they could get for a parasol or a bit of lace or a calico dress
  or a sack of coffee. Their chief problem was how to sell all these things
  to the best advantage afterward. Usually they found their best market down
  the river.</p>
<p>So when Ed Lowry presented the case to them they were quick to see advantage
  in it. His proposal was that the boys should provide the flatboat and take
  her to New Orleans at their own expense; that the merchants should furnish
  a cargo to be sold on commission either at New Orleans or on “the coast,”
  as the river country for a few hundred miles above that city is called,
  the boys to have a certain part of the money as freight and a certain other
  part as “commission.”</p>
<p>Every merchant in town was ready to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> furnish
  a part of the cargo, and it seemed altogether probable that the boys would
  easily secure more freight than they could carry, though their flatboat
  was to be one of the biggest that ever floated down the river. As she was
  likely also to be one of the last, coming as she did long after that system
  of river transportation had been generally abandoned, Irv Strong, in a
  burst of eloquence, proposed that she should be called <i>The Last of the
  Flatboats</i>, in order, he said, “that she may take rank with those noble
  literary productions, ‘The Last of the Barons,’ ‘The Last of the Mohicans,’
  ‘The Last of the Mamelukes,’ ‘The Last Days of Pompeii,’ and ‘The Lay of
  the Last Minstrel.’”</p>
<p>Ed Lowry laughed, and the other boys voted for the name proposed.</p>
<p>As the boat was nearing completion, a few weeks later, and indeed had
  already received a part of her cargo, the question arose, who should be
  her captain.</p>
<p>The first impulse of everybody concerned was to say “Ed Lowry,” but Ed
  vetoed that.</p>
<p>“I’m an invalid,” he said, “or half an invalid at the best, and this thing
  isn’t play.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> There
  are very serious duties for the captain of a flatboat to do. He must be
  able to expose himself in all weathers, which I can’t do. He must be ready
  in resource and very quick to decide. In an emergency, it is far more important
  to have a quick decision than a wise one, and especially to have the one
  who decides a resolute person who will carry his decision into effect.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Irving Strong. “What we need in a captain is ‘obstinate
  pertinacity.’ I move that Phil Lowry, as the possessor of a large and varied
  stock of that commodity, be made captain of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>.”</p>
<p>As Phil was the very youngest of the group, and as he had always been
  regarded rather as a ready than a discreet thinker, there was a moment’s
  hesitation. But a little thought convinced every one of the boys that Phil
  was by all odds the one among them best fit to undertake the difficult
  task of command—the one most likely to bring the enterprise to a successful
  termination, especially if any serious difficulties should arise, as was
  pretty certain to happen.</p>
<p>“It’s an awful responsibility for Phil to assume,” said Ed that night
  to their widowed mother, a woman of unusual wisdom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes,” she replied; “but, after all, he is the one best fit, and that
  ought to be the only ground on which men or boys are selected for places
  of responsibility. Besides, it will educate Philip in much that he needs
  to learn. No matter what happens on the voyage, he will come back the better
  for it. He ought to have the discipline that responsibility gives. The
  one lesson he most needs to learn is that he is not merely an individual,
  but a part of a whole: that his conduct in any case affects others as well
  as himself, and that he is, therefore, responsible to others and for others.
  It is well that you boys have made him your captain. Now remember to hold
  up his hands and obey him loyally in every case of doubt. That will be
  hard for you, Edward, because of your superior knowledge—”</p>
<p>“No, it won’t, mother, pardon me,” responded Ed: “first, because I know
  too much about some things not to know that other people know more than
  I do about others; and secondly, because I thoroughly understand what Napoleon
  meant when he said that ‘one bad general in command of an army is better
  than two good ones.’ The most unwise order promptly executed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> usually
  results better than the wisest order left open to debate. Phil will never
  leave things open to debate when the time comes for quick action, and besides,
  mother, I have a much better opinion of Phil’s capacity for command than
  you think. His readiness and resourcefulness are remarkable. He may or
  he may not get us safely to New Orleans. But if he doesn’t, I shall be
  perfectly certain that nobody else in the party could.”</p>
<p>So it was that Phil Lowry, the youngest of the party, and the most harum-scarum
  boy in all Vevay, was chosen captain of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> by
  those who were to voyage with him, simply because they all believed him
  to be the one best fit for the place.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A HURRY CALL</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> theorizing about it, and, indeed, without
  knowing the fact, Phil began at once to rise to his responsibility. The
  success of the enterprise, he felt, depended in a large degree upon him,
  and he must think of everything necessary in advance.</p>
<p>One night, late in September, he asked his comrades to meet him “on business”
  in Will Moreraud’s room over a store. When they were all gathered around
  the little pine table with a smoky lamp on it, Phil drew out a carefully
  prepared memorandum and laid it before him. Then he began:—</p>
<p>“As you’ve made me responsible in this business, I’ve been studying up
  a little. The river’s going to rise earlier than usual this year, and in
  two weeks at most there’ll be water enough to get the boat over the falls
  at Louisville.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>“How do you know that?” broke in Constant Thiebaud, incredulously.</p>
<p>“Because there has already been a smart rise all along, as you know, and
  heavy rains are falling in the West Virginia and Pennsylvania mountains.
  The Allegheny River is bank full; the Monongahela is over its banks; and
  the Muskingum and the Big Kanawha and the Little Kanawha are all rising
  fast. There’ll be lots of water here almost before we know it.”</p>
<p>“Whew!” cried Irving Strong, rising,—for he could never sit still when
  anything interesting was under discussion,—“but how in the name of all
  the ’ologies do you know what’s going on in the Virginia mountains, and
  the rivers, and all that?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been reading the Cincinnati papers every day since you made me ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>’;
  that’s all. Mr. Schenck lends them to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, Gee Whillicks!” exclaimed Constant, “who’d ’a’ thought of that!”</p>
<p>“No matter,” said Phil, a little abashed by the approbation of his foresight
  which he saw in all the boys’ eyes and heard in all their voices. “No matter
  about that; but I’ve more to say. The sooner we can get away with the flatboat,
  the better.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why? What difference does it make?”</p>
<p>“Well, for most of the things we are taking as freight the prices are
  apt to be much higher in the fall than later, after the steamboats load
  up the market. That’s what Mr. Shaw says, and he knows. So we must get
  the boat loaded just as quickly as we can, and go out as soon as there
  is water enough to get her over the falls.”</p>
<p>“But we can’t do that,” said Ed, “because most of the produce we are to
  take hasn’t been brought to town yet. The hay is here, of course, but apples
  have hardly begun to come in—”</p>
<p>“That’s just what I’m coming to,” interrupted Phil. “I’ve been studying
  all that. We could get enough freight for two cargoes by waiting for it,
  but the best figuring I can do shows only about three-quarters of a load
  now actually in town. I propose that we go to work to-morrow and get the
  other quarter. That’s what I called you together for.”</p>
<p>“Where are we to get it?”</p>
<p>“Along the river, below town—in the neighborhood of Craig’s Landing.”</p>
<p>“But how?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“By hustling. I’ve made out a list of everybody that produces anything
  for ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> miles
  down the river and five miles back into the hills,—Mr. Larcom, Captain
  John Wright, Johnny Lampson, Mr. Albritton, Gersham McCallum and his brother
  Neil, Algy Wright, Mr. Minnit, Dr. Caine, Mr. Violet—and so on. Craig’s
  Landing is the nearest there is to all of them, and they can all get their
  produce there quickly. I propose that every boy in the crew take his foot
  in his hand early to-morrow morning, and that we visit every farmer in
  the list and persuade him to send his stuff to the landing at once. I’ve
  already seen Captain Wright,—saw him in town to-day,—and he promises me
  thirty barrels of apples and seventy bushels of onions with some other
  things. I’ll go myself to Johnny Lampson. He has at least a hundred barrels
  of apples, and I’ll get them. They aren’t picked yet, but I’ll offer him
  our services to pick them immediately for low wages, and so—”</p>
<p>“I say, boys!” broke in Irv Strong, “I move three cheers for ‘obstinate
  pertinacity.’ It’s the thing that ‘goes’ in this sort of business.”</p>
<p>“And in most others,” quietly rejoined Ed Lowry. “I’m afraid I’ve never
  properly appreciated it till now.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>Phil had some other details to suggest, for he had been trying very earnestly
  to think of everything needful.</p>
<p>They would need some skiffs, and he reported that Perry Raymond had six
  new ones, of his own building, which he proposed to let them have as a
  part of the cargo. They were to use any of them as needed on the voyage,
  and their use was to offset freight charges. They were to sell the skiffs
  at New Orleans or above, and to have a part of the proceeds as commission.</p>
<p>“I move we accept the offer,” said Will Moreraud. “It’s a good one.”</p>
<p>“It is already accepted,” replied the young captain a trifle sharply.
  “<i>I</i> closed the bargain at once.”</p>
<p>His tone was not arrogant, but it was authoritative. It was a new one
  for him to take, and it rather surprised the boys, but on the whole it
  did not displease them. It meant that their young captain intended to be
  something more effective than the chairman of a debating club; that having
  been asked to assume authority, he purposed to exercise it; that being
  in command, he meant to command in fact as well as in name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Some of them talked the matter over later that evening, and though they
  felt a trifle resentful at first, they finally concluded that the boy’s
  new attitude promised well for the enterprise, and, better still, that
  it was right.</p>
<p>“You see he isn’t ‘cocky’ about it at all,” said Will Moreraud; “it just
  means that in this game he’s ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’ and he’s
  going to give the word.”</p>
<p>“It means a good deal more than that,” said shrewd Irv Strong, who had
  been born the son of an officer in a regular army post. “It means we’ve
  picked out the right fellow to be our ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’
  and I, for one, stand ready to support him with my eyes shut, every time!”</p>
<p>“So do I,” cried out all the lads in chorus. “Only you see,” said Constant,
  “we didn’t quite expect it from Phil. Well—maybe if we had, we’d have voted
  still louder for him for captain; that is, if we’ve got any real sense.”</p>
<p>“It means,” said Ed, gravely, “that if we fail to get <i>The Last of the
    Flatboats</i> safely to New Orleans, it will be our own fault, not his.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Irving Strong. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> who’d
  ever have expected that rattlepate to think out everything as he has done?”</p>
<p>“And to be so desperately in earnest about it, too!” said another.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” responded Irving. “You remember how he stuck to
  that cistern sum. It’s his way, only he’s never before had so serious a
  matter as this to deal with, and I imagine we have never quite known what
  stuff he’s made of.”</p>
<p>“Anyhow,” said Will, “we’re ‘his to command,’ and we’ll see him through.”</p>
<p>With a shout of applause for this sentiment the boys separated for sleep.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE BANKS OF THE WONDERFUL RIVER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a busy fortnight that followed. The
  boys visited every farmer within six miles of the landing to secure whatever
  freight he might be willing to furnish. They picked and barrelled all of
  Lampson’s apples, dug and bagged and barrelled all the potatoes in that
  neighborhood, and got together many small lots of onions, garlic, dried
  beans, and the like, including about ten barrels of eggs. These last they
  collected in baskets, a few dozen from each farm, and packed them at the
  landing. Of course every shipper’s freight had to be separately marked
  and receipted for, so that the proper returns might be made.</p>
<p>During all this time the boys had lived in a camp of their own making
  at the landing, partly to guard the freight against thieves, partly to
  get used to cooking, etc., for themselves, partly to learn to “rough it,”
  generally, and more than all because, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> healthy-minded
  boys, they liked camping for its own sake.</p>
<p>Their little shelter was on the shore, just under the bank. They occupied
  it only during rains. At other times they lived night and day in the open
  air. They worked all day, of course, leaving one of their number on guard,
  but when night came, they had what Homer calls a “great bearded fire,”
  built against a fallen sycamore tree of gigantic size, and after supper
  they sat by it chatting till it was time to sleep.</p>
<p>They were usually tired, but they were excited also, and that often kept
  them awake pretty late. The vision of the voyage had taken hold upon their
  imaginations. They pictured to themselves the calm joy of floating fifteen
  hundred miles and more down the great river, of seeing strange, subtropical
  regions that had hitherto been but names to them, seeming as remote as
  the Nile country itself until now.</p>
<p>And as they thought, they talked, but mainly their talk consisted of questions
  fired at Ed Lowry, who was very justly suspected of knowing about ten times
  as much about most things as anybody else in the company.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, one night Irv Strong got to “supposing” things and asking Ed
  about them.</p>
<p>“Suppose we run on a sawyer,” he said. Ed had been telling them about
  that particularly dangerous sort of snag.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ed, “we’ll try to avoid that, by keeping as nearly as we
  can in the channel.”</p>
<p>“But suppose we find that a particularly malignant sawyer has squatted
  down in the middle of the channel, and is laying for us there?”</p>
<p>“I doubt if sawyers often do that,” said Ed, meditatively.</p>
<p>“Well, but suppose one cantankerous old sawyer should do so,” insisted
  Irv. “You can ‘suppose a case’ and make a sawyer anywhere you please, can’t
  you?”</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. Then Ed said: “Now listen to me, boys. I’ve been getting
  together all the books I can borrow that tell anything about the country
  we’re going through, and I’ll have them all on board. My plan is to lie
  on my back in the shade somewhere and read them while you fellows pull
  at the oars, cook the meals, and do the work generally. Then, when you
  happen to have a little leisure, as you will now and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> then,
  I’ll tell you what I’ve learned by my reading.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s your plan, is it?” asked Phil.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve thought it all out carefully,” laughed Ed.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll find out before we get far down the river what the duties
  of a flatboat hand are, and you’ll <i>do</i> ’em, too, ‘accordin’ to the
  measure of your strength,’ as old Mr. Moon always says in experience meeting.”</p>
<p>“But reading and telling us about it is what Ed can do best,” said Will
  Moreraud, “and that’s what we’re taking him along for.”</p>
<p>“Not a bit of it,” quickly responded Phil. “We’re taking him along to
  make him well and strong like the rest of us, and I’m going to keep him
  off his back and on his feet as much as possible, and besides—”</p>
<p>“But, Phil, old fellow,” Ed broke in, “didn’t you understand that I was
  only joking?”</p>
<p>Ed asked the question with a tender solicitude to which Phil responded
  promptly.</p>
<p>“Of course I did,” he replied. “You always do your share in everything,
  and sometimes more. But I don’t think you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> understand.
  You know we started this thing for you. I don’t know—maybe you’ll never
  get well if we don’t do our best to make you—” but Phil had choked up by
  this time, and he broke away from the group and went down by the river.
  A little later Ed joined him there and, grasping his hand, said:—</p>
<p>“I understand, old fellow.”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t; at least not quite,” replied the boy, who had now recovered
  control of his voice. “You see it’s this way. You and I are <i>twins</i>.
  You’re some years older than I am, of course, but we’ve always been twins
  just the same.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand all that, and feel it.”</p>
<p>“No, not all,” persisted the younger boy. “You see I’ve got all the health
  there is between us, and it isn’t fair. If you should—well, if anything
  should happen to you, I’d never forgive myself for not finding out some
  way of dividing health with you—”</p>
<p>“But, my dear brother—” broke in Ed.</p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt me, now,” said Phil, almost hysterically, “because I
  must tell you this so that you will understand. When we made up this scheme
  and you fellows chose me captain, I got to thinking how much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> depended
  on me. There was the cargo, representing other people’s money, and I was
  responsible for that. There was the safety of the boat and crew, and that
  depended upon me, too. But these weren’t the heavy things to me. There
  was your health! That depended on me in a fearful way. I felt that I must
  find out what was best for you to do and then <i>make</i> you do it.” He
  laughed a little. “That sounds funny, doesn’t it? The idea of my ‘making’
  you do things!—Never mind that. I went to Dr. Gale—”</p>
<p>“What for?” asked Ed, in astonishment at this new revelation of the change
  in Phil’s happy-go-lucky ways.</p>
<p>“To find out just what it would be best for you to do and not to do, in
  order to make you well and strong like me.” He choked a little, but presently
  recovered himself and continued. “I found out, and I mean to <i>make</i> you
  do the things that will save you, even if you hate me for my—”</p>
<p>He could say no more. There was no need. Ed, with his ready mind and big,
  generous heart, understood, though he wondered. He grasped his brother’s
  hand again and said, between something like sobs:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>“And I’ll obey you, Phil! Thank you, and God bless you! Be sure I could
  never hate you or do anything but love you, and you must always know that
  I understand.”</p>
<p>Then the two turned away from each other.</p>
<p>On their return to Vevay a few evenings later, Ed said to his mother:—</p>
<p>“You were right, mother; responsibility has already worked a miracle in
  Phil’s character.”</p>
<p>“No, you are wrong,” said the wise mother. “It is only that you have never
  quite understood your brother until now. Nothing really changes character—at
  least nothing changes it suddenly. Circumstances do not alter the character
  of men or women or boys. They only call out what is already there. Responsibility
  and his great affection for you have not changed your brother in the least.
  They have only served to make you acquainted with him as you never were
  before.”</p>
<p>“Be very sure I shall never misunderstand him again!” said the boy, with
  an earnestness not to be mistaken.</p>

“They worked like beavers getting cargo aboard.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THE PILOT</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys went hurriedly back to Vevay. They
  had cargo enough and to spare. Indeed, they feared they might have difficulty
  in bestowing it all on their boat. And the rise in the river was coming
  even earlier and faster than Phil had calculated. They must get the Vevay
  part of their load on board and drop down to Craig’s Landing before the
  water should reach their freight there, which lay near the river. So they
  hired a farm hand to watch the goods at the landing and hastened to town.</p>
<p>There they worked like beavers, getting cargo aboard, for it was no part
  of their plan to waste money hiring anybody to do for them anything that
  they could do for themselves. They loaded the boat under Perry Raymond’s
  supervision, for even the tightest and stiffest boat can be made to leak
  like a sieve if badly loaded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, everything was ready. The town part of the cargo was well bestowed.
  Ed Lowry had deposited his books on top of tiers of hay bales, in between
  barrels, and in every other available space, for there was no room for
  them in the little cabin at the stern, where the boys must cook, eat, sleep,
  and live. The cabin wasn’t over twelve feet by ten in dimensions, and a
  large part of its space was taken up by the six sleeping-bunks. For besides
  themselves there was a pilot to be provided for.</p>
<p>His name was Jim Hughes. Beyond that nobody knew anything about him. He
  had come to Vevay, from nowhere in particular, only a few days before the
  flatboat’s departure, and asked to be taken as pilot. He was willing to
  go in that capacity without wages. He wanted “to get down the river,” he
  said, and professed to know the channels fairly well.</p>
<p>“If he does,” said Ed Lowry, “he knows a good deal more than most of the
  old-time flatboat pilots did. With the maps I’ve secured I think we can
  float the boat down the river without much need of a pilot anyhow. But
  as Hughes offers to go for his passage, we might as well take him along.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> We
  may get into a situation where his knowledge of the river, if he has any,
  will be of use to us.”</p>
<p>So Jim Hughes was shipped as pilot of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>.</p>
<p>When all was ready that gallant craft was cast loose at the Ferry street
  landing, and as she drifted into the strong current, there was a cheer
  from the boys on shore who had assembled to see their schoolmates off.</p>
<p>“She floats upon the bosom of the waters,” cried Irv Strong, “with all
  the grace of a cow learning to dance the hornpipe.”</p>
<p>Irv was in exuberant spirits, as he always was in fact. He was like soda
  water with all its fizz in it, no matter what the circumstances might be,
  and just now the circumstances were altogether favorable.</p>
<p>“I say, boys,” he cried, “let’s have a little dance on deck! Tune up your
  fiddle, Constant.”</p>
<p>Constant dived into the cabin and quickly returned with his violin, playing
  a jig even as he emerged from the little trap-door at the top of the steps.</p>
<p>Phil did not join in the dance, for he had discovered a cause of anxiety.
  Their pilot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> was
  making a great show of activity where none whatever was needed. From the
  Ferry street landing to “The Point” the current ran swiftly in a straight
  line, and if let alone, the boat would have gone in precisely the right
  direction. But Hughes was not letting her alone. With long sweeps of his
  great steering-oar he was driving her out dangerously near the head of
  the bar, now under water but still a shoal.</p>
<p>Phil, who was observing closely, called out:—</p>
<p>“I say, Jim, you must run further inshore, or you’ll hit the head of the
  bar.”</p>
<p>“Lem me alone,” said Jim. “I know the river.”</p>
<p>Just then the boat scraped bottom on the bar. Phil called out quickly:—</p>
<p>“All hands to the larboard oars! Give it to her hard!” and himself seizing
  the steering oar, he managed by a hair’s breadth to swing the great box—for
  that is all that a flatboat is—into the deep and rapid channel near the
  Indiana shore.</p>
<p>As she drifted into safe water, Phil said:—</p>
<p>“That’s incident number one in the voyage.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, and it came pretty near being chapter first and last in the log-book
  of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>,” replied Irv Strong.</p>
<p>For several miles now there was nothing to do but float. But Phil was
  closely watching Jim Hughes and observed that that worthy made three visits
  to the hold,—as the cargo part of the boat is called,—going down each time
  by the forward ladder and not by the stairs leading to the cabin.</p>
<p>When the boat reached the big eddy about half a mile above Craig’s Landing,
  it was necessary for all hands to go to the oars again in order to make
  the landing.</p>
<p>Presently Phil observed that Hughes was steering wildly. His efforts with
  the steering oar were throwing the boat far out into the river, away from
  the shore on which they were to land, and directly toward the head of a
  strong channel which at this stage of water ran like a mill-race along
  the Kentucky shore on the farther side of Craig’s bar. Should the boat
  be sucked into that channel, she would be carried many miles down the stream
  before she could ever be landed even on the wrong side of the river, and
  she could never come back to Craig’s Landing unless towed back by a steamboat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>Phil, seeing the danger, asked: “Why don’t you keep her inshore?”</p>
<p>“None o’ yer business. I’m steerin’,” answered the pilot.</p>
<p>One quick, searching glance showed Phil the extent of the man’s drunkenness,—or
  his pretence of drunkenness,—for Phil had doubts of it. There were certain
  indications lacking. Yet if the fellow was shamming, he was doing it exceedingly
  well. His tongue seemed thick, his eyes glazed, and his walk across the
  deck appeared to be a mere stagger, supported by the great oar that he
  was wielding to such mischievous effect.</p>
<p>There was not a moment to be lost if the landing was to be made at all.
  Phil called all the boys to the larboard sweep and went to take possession
  of the steering-oar. Jim Hughes resisted violently. Phil, with a quietude
  that nobody had ever before seen him display under strong excitement, picked
  up a bit of board from the deck, and instantly knocked the big hulking
  fellow down by a blow on the head.</p>
<p>The man did not get up again or indeed manifest consciousness in any way.
  If this troubled the boy, as of course it must, he at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> least
  did not let it interfere with his duty. He had a difficult task to do and
  he must do it quickly. He gave his whole mind to that. The boys obeyed
  with a will his shouted orders to “pull hard!” then for two of them to
  go to the starboard oar and “back like killing snakes.” In a little while
  the boat swung round, and Phil called to Will Moreraud to “take a line
  ashore in the skiff and make it fast.” The youth did so, just in time to
  prevent the boat from grounding in the shoal water below the landing.</p>
<p>When everything was secure and the strenuous work done, the boy sank down
  upon the deck and called to his brother.</p>
<p>“See if I’ve killed him, won’t you, Ed? <i>I</i> can’t.”</p>
<p>A very slight examination showed that, while the blow from the bit of
  plank had brought some blood from the pilot’s head, it had done no serious
  damage. His stupor, it was Ed’s opinion, was due to whiskey, not to his
  chastisement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was a very bad beginning to the voyage, and Phil was strongly
  disposed to discharge the fellow then and there, and trust, as he put it,
  to “a good map, open eyes, and ordinary common sense, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> better
  pilots than a drunken lout who probably doesn’t know the river even when
  he is sober.”</p>
<p>But the other boys dissuaded him. They thought that Jim’s intoxication
  was the result of his joy at getting off; that they could find his jug
  in its hiding-place and throw it overboard,—which presently they did,—and
  that after he should get sober, Jim’s experience in flat-boating might
  be of great advantage to them.</p>
<p>“You see,” said Ed Lowry, “we’ve taken a big responsibility. All this
  freight, worth thousands of dollars, belongs to other people, and I suppose
  half of it isn’t even insured because the rates on flatboats are so high.
  Think if we should lose it for lack of a pilot!”</p>
<p>“Yes, think of that!” said two or three in a breath.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Phil. “I yield to your judgment. But my own opinion
  is that such a pilot is worse than none. I’ll keep him for the present.
  But I’ll watch him, and if he gets any more whiskey or plays us any more
  tricks, I’ll set him ashore once for all if it’s in the middle of an Arkansas
  swamp.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>The river was rising now, more and more rapidly every hour. There was
  three days’ work to do getting the rest of the cargo aboard and making
  room for it in the crowded hold. But at Ed Lowry’s suggestion the boys
  avoided overtaxing themselves. The energetic Swiss blood in the veins of
  Constant Thiebaud and Will Moreraud prompted them to favor long hours for
  work on the plea that they could make it up by rest while floating down
  the river.</p>
<p>But under Ed’s advice Phil overruled them, and it was decided to breakfast
  at six o’clock, work from seven to twelve, dine, rest for an hour, and
  work again till five.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">TALKING</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasantest part of the day, under this
  arrangement, was that between five o’clock and bedtime.</p>
<p>The boys talked then, and talking is about the very best thing that anybody
  ever does. It is by talk that we come to know those about us and make ourselves
  known to them. It is by talk that we learn to like our fellows, by learning
  what there is in them worth liking. And it is by talk mainly that we find
  out what we think and correct our thinking.</p>
<p>Ed Lowry was reading a book one day, when suddenly he looked up and said:—</p>
<p>“I say, fellows, this is good. Lord Macaulay said he never knew what he
  thought about any subject until he had talked about it. Of course that’s
  so with all of us, when you come to think of it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Phil. “I often talk about things and don’t
  know what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> I
  think about ’em even after I’ve talked. Here’s this big bond robbery, for
  example. I’ve read all about it in the Cincinnati newspapers and I’ve talked
  you fellows deaf, dumb, and blind concerning it. Yet, I don’t know even
  now what I think about it.”</p>
<p>“I know what I think,” said Will Moreraud. “I think the detectives are
  ‘all off.’”</p>
<p>“How?” asked all the boys in chorus.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re trying to find the man who is supposed to be carrying the
  plunder. It seems to me they’d better look for the other fellows first;
  for if they were caught, they’d soon enough tell where the man that carries
  it is. They wouldn’t go to jail and leave him with the stuff.”</p>
<p>“The worst of it is they’re publishing descriptions of the fellow and
  even of what they’ve noticed concerning his clothes and beard, as if a
  thief that was up to a game like that wouldn’t change his clothes and part
  his hair differently and wear a different sort of beard, especially after
  he’s been told what they’re looking for.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said Irving Strong, reading from one of Phil’s Cincinnati
  newspapers:</p>
<p>“‘Red hair’—a man might dye that—‘parted on the left side and brushed
  forward’—he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> might
  part it in the middle and brush it back, or have it all cut off with one
  of those mowing machines the barbers use, just as Jim Hughes does with
  his—”</p>
<p>“Now I come to think of it,” continued Irv, after a moment’s thought,
  “Jim answers the description in several ways,—limps a little with his left
  leg, has red hair when he permits himself to have any hair at all, has
  lost a front tooth, and speaks with a slight lisp.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jim Hughes isn’t a bank burglar,” exclaimed Will Moreraud. “He hasn’t
  sense enough for anything of that sort.”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” said Irv. “I didn’t mean to suggest anything of the kind.
  I merely cited his peculiarities to show how easily a detective’s description
  might lead men into mistakes. Why, Jim might even be arrested on that description.”</p>
<p>“But all that isn’t what Macaulay meant,” said Ed. “He meant that a man
  never really knows what he thinks about any subject till he has put his
  thought into words and then turned it over and looked at it and found out
  exactly what it is.”</p>
<p>“I guess that’s so,” drawled Irv. “I notice that whenever I try to think
  seriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>—”</p>
<p>The boys all laughed. The idea of Irv Strong’s thinking seriously seemed
  peculiarly humorous to them.</p>
<p>“Well, I do try sometimes,” said Irv, “and whenever I do, I put the whole
  thing into the exactest words I can find. Very often, when I get it into
  exact words, I find that my opinions won’t hang together and I’ve got to
  reconstruct them.”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” said Ed Lowry. “And that is the great difficulty animals have
  in trying to think. They haven’t any words even in their minds. They can’t
  put their thoughts into form so as to examine them. It seems to me that
  language is necessary to any real thinking, and that it is the possession
  of language more than anything or everything else that makes man really
  the lord of creation.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Phil. “Even Bre’r Rabbit and Bre’r Fox and all the rest of
  them are represented as putting their thoughts into words.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Irv, “that’s the reason why educated people think more
  soundly than uneducated ones. They have a nicer sense of the meaning of
  words.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Ed. “I suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> is
  what President Eliot of Harvard meant when he said that ‘the object of
  education is to teach a man to express his thought clearly in his own language.’”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Phil. “My own thought, clearly expressed in my own language,
  is that it’s time for supper. Come, stir your stumps, ye philosophical
  pundits! Bring me the skillet and the frying-pan, the salt pork to fry,
  and prepare the apples and potatoes and eggs to cook in the fat thereof.
  In the classic language of our own time, get a move on you, and don’t forget
  the coffeepot; nor yet the coffee that is to be steeped therein!”</p>
<p>The boys were ready enough to respond. Their appetites, sharpened by hard
  work in the open air, were clamorously keen. The supper promised—fried
  pork, fried apples, fried eggs, and coffee with a short-cake—seemed to
  them quite all that could be desired in the way of luxury. They could eat
  it with relish, and sleep in entire comfort afterward. Probably not one
  of my readers in a hundred could digest such a supper at all. That is because
  not one reader in a hundred gives himself a chance for robust health by
  working nine hours a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> day
  and living almost entirely in the open air.</p>
<p>Jim came out when supper was ready and helped eat it there on the shore.
  At other than mealtimes it was his custom to stay on board the flatboat,
  and not only so, but to keep himself below decks, although the weather
  was still very warm. He had got over his drunkenness, but he was still
  moody, apparently in resentment of the rough-and-ready treatment he had
  received at Phil’s hands.</p>
<p>He rarely talked at all; when he did talk, it was usually in the dialect
  of an entirely uneducated person. But now and then he used expressions
  that no such person would employ.</p>
<p>“He seems to slip into his grammar now and then,” was Irv Strong’s way
  of putting it.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THE RIGHT TO THE RIVER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time that the last of the cargo was
  bestowed, the boat was so full that there was scarcely a place in which
  to hang the four fire-extinguishers which Mr. Schenck had supplied for
  the protection of the cargo, of which he owned a considerable part.</p>
<p>The river by this time was bank full. Indeed, the flatboat lay that last
  night almost under an apple tree, and directly over the place where three
  days before the boys had cooked their meals.</p>
<p>When the final start was made, therefore, it was only necessary to give
  three or four strokes of the great “sweeps” to shove the craft out into
  the stream. After that she was left free to float. The biggest bars were
  at least ten feet under water, and the boat “drew” less than three feet,
  heavily laden as she was. For the rest, the current could be depended upon
  to “keep her in the river,” as boatmen say, and the boys had nothing to
  do,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> between
  Craig’s Landing and Louisville, fifty or sixty miles below, except pump
  a little now and then, cook their meals, and set up the proper lights at
  night. Of course someone was always “on watch,” but as the time was divided
  between the five, that amounted to very little.</p>
<p>As the boat neared Louisville, Ed suggested to his brother that he had
  better land above the town, and not within its limits.</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Phil. “We’ve got to get some provisions as well as hire a
  falls pilot, and it will be more convenient if we land at the levee.”</p>
<p>“But it will cost us five or ten dollars in good money for wharfage,”
  replied Ed.</p>
<p>“But if we land above the town, how do we know the man owning the land
  on which we tie up won’t charge us just as much?” asked Irv Strong, who
  had never seen a large city and wanted to get as good a glimpse as he could
  of this one.</p>
<p>“Because the Mississippi River and its tributaries are not ‘navigable’
  waters, but <i>are</i> ‘public highways for purposes of commerce,’” responded
  Ed. “If they weren’t that last, we couldn’t run this boat down them at
  all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>“Not navigable?” queried Will Moreraud. “Well, looking at that big steamboat
  out there, which has just come from Cincinnati, that statement seems a
  trifle absurd.”</p>
<p>“Let me explain,” said Ed. “The English common law, from which we get
  ours, calls no stream ‘navigable’ unless the tide ebbs and flows in it.
  And as the tide does not ebb and flow in the Mississippi much above New
  Orleans, neither that great river nor any of its splendid tributaries are
  recognized by the law as navigable.”</p>
<p>“Then the law is an idiot,” said Irv Strong.</p>
<p>“One of Dickens’s characters said something like that,” responded Ed,
  “when he was told that the law supposes a married woman always acts under
  direction of her husband. But both he and you are wrong, particularly you,
  as you’ll see when I explain. It is absolutely necessary for the law to
  determine just how far a man’s ownership of land lying along a stream extends.
  You see that?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” was the general response.</p>
<p>“Yes,” continued Ed, “otherwise very perplexing questions would arise
  as to what a man might or might not do along shore. Now in England, where
  our law on the subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> comes
  from, it is a fact that the tide ebbs and flows in all the navigable parts
  of the rivers and nowhere else. So the law made the tide the test, or rather
  recognized it as a test already established by nature.</p>
<p>“Now in order that commerce might be carried on, the law decreed that
  the owner of land lying on a navigable stream should own only to the edge
  of the bank—or to the ‘natural break of the bank,’ as the law writers express
  it. This was to prevent owners of the shores from levying tribute on ships
  that might need to land or anchor in front of their property.</p>
<p>“But on streams that were not navigable, no such need existed. On the
  contrary, it was very desirable, for many reasons, that the owners of the
  banks should be free to deal as they saw fit with the streams in front—to
  straighten or deepen them, and all that sort of thing. So the law decreed
  that on streams not navigable the owner of the bank should own to ‘the
  middle thread of the water,’ wherever that might happen to be.</p>
<p>“Now as all these great rivers of ours, the very greatest in the world,
  by the way, are in law non-navigable, it follows that the men who own their
  banks own the rivers also, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> man
  on each side owning to the middle thread of water. Naturally, these men
  could step in and say that nobody should run a boat through their part
  of the river without paying whatever toll they might choose to charge.
  Under such a system it would be impossible to use the rivers at all. It
  would cost nobody knows how many thousands of dollars in tolls to run a
  boat, say from Cincinnati to New Orleans.”</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t it, then?” asked Will Moreraud. “Why can’t every farmer
  whose land we pass come out and make us pay for using his part of the river?”</p>
<p>“For the same reason,” said Ed, “that the farmer can’t come out and make
  you pay toll for passing over a public road which happens to cross his
  land.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean? I don’t understand,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Well, the only reason the farmer can’t make you pay toll for crossing
  his land on a public road is, that the road is made by law a public highway,
  open to everybody’s use, and it is a criminal offence for anybody to obstruct
  it, either by setting up a toll-gate, or building a fence, or felling trees
  across it, or in any other way whatever. And tha<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>t’s
  the only reason a man who owns land along these rivers can’t charge toll
  for their use or put any sort of obstruction in them without getting himself
  into trouble with the law for his pains.”</p>
<p>“How’s that?” asked one of the boys. “This river isn’t a public road.”</p>
<p>“That is precisely what it is,” said Ed. “Realizing the difficulty created
  by the fact that this great river system is not legally navigable while
  its actual navigation is a common necessity, Congress early passed a law
  making the Mississippi River and all its tributaries ‘public highways for
  purposes of commerce.’ That’s why nobody can prevent you from running boats
  on them, or charge you for the privilege.”</p>
<p>The boys were deeply interested in the explanation, which was new to them,
  and so they sat silent for a while, thinking it over, as people are apt
  to do when they have heard something new that interests them.</p>
<p>Presently Phil said:—</p>
<p>“That’s all very clear and I understand it, but I don’t quite see what
  it has to do with where we land at Louisville.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ed, “I can explain that. As the river is a public highway
  for purposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> of
  commerce, nobody can charge you for any legitimate use of it, or its shores
  below high-water mark, such use, for example, as landing in front of his
  property, a thing which may be absolutely necessary to navigation. But
  if a man or a city chooses to spend money in making your landing easy and
  convenient, say by building a levee or wharf, putting in posts for you
  to make your boat fast by, or anything of the kind, that man or city has
  a right to charge you, not for landing, but for the use of the improvements
  and conveniences.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I see,” said Phil. “Every city does that, and so if you land
  at its improved landing, you must pay. Well, we’ll land on unimproved shores
  above Louisville, and above or below every other town that we have occasion
  to land at. That’s business. But I don’t see why Congress didn’t solve
  the whole riddle by adopting a new rule as to what are and what are not
  navigable streams.”</p>
<p>“What rule?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Well, the common-sense rule, that a stream which is actually navigable
  shall be regarded as navigable in law.”</p>
<p>“Actually navigable by what?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> Ed.
  “There isn’t a spring branch in all the country that isn’t actually navigable
  by some sort of boat. Even a wash-basin will float a toy boat.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I mean real boats.”</p>
<p>“Of what size?”</p>
<p>“Well, big enough to carry freight or passengers.”</p>
<p>“Any skiff drawing three inches of water can do that. Such a rule would
  include Indian Creek and Long Run, and even all the branches we go wading
  in, as navigable streams. And then again, some streams are practically
  navigable even by steamboats at some seasons of the year, and almost or
  altogether dry at others. This great Ohio River of ours, in its upper parts
  at least, goes pretty nearly dry some summers. No, I don’t see how any
  other line than that of the tide could have been drawn, or how the other
  difficulty could have been met in any better way than by declaring the
  Mississippi and all its tributaries ‘public highways for purposes of commerce.’
  That was the simplest way out, and the simplest way is usually the best
  way.”<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes,” said Irv Strong, “and as the simplest way to relieve hunger is
  to eat, I move that we stop talking and get dinner.”</p>
<p>The suggestion was accepted without dissent, and the two whose turn it
  was to cook went below to start a fire in the stove.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">WHAT HAPPENED AT LOUISVILLE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> before the landing was made at Louisville,
  Jim Hughes was seized with an attack of cramps and took to his bunk, where
  he remained until near the time for the boat to be afloat again. The boys
  had feared that he might go ashore there and get a new supply of liquor,
  and they had even made careful plans to prevent him from bringing any aboard.
  His sudden sickness rendered all their plans superfluous.</p>
<p>At Louisville Phil got a fresh supply of newspapers, giving all the latest
  news concerning the great bond robbery, and took them aboard to read at
  leisure. He learned that there was no need of hiring a pilot to take the
  boat over the falls, which in fact are not falls at all, but merely rapids.
  At very high water such as just then prevailed, the only difference between
  that part of the river called the falls and any other part was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> that
  part had a much swifter and far less steady current than prevailed elsewhere.</p>
<p>“I could take your money for piloting you over the falls,” said the genial
  old pilot to whom Phil had applied, “but it would be robbery. I’m a pilot,
  not a pirate, you see. All you’ve got to do, my boy, is to put your flatboat
  well out into the river and let her go. She’ll amble over the falls at
  this stage of the water as gently as a well-built girl waltzes over a ball-room
  floor. She’ll turn round and round, just as the girl does, but it’ll be
  just as innocent-like. There’ll be never less than twenty-five foot o’
  water under your gunwales, and there simply can’t any harm come to you.
  Don’t pay anybody anything to pilot you over. Do it yourself, and if anything
  happens to you, just let old Jabez Brown know where it happened, please.
  For if there’s any new rocks sprouted up on the falls of the Ohio since
  the water rose, an old falls pilot like me just naterally wants to know
  about ’em.”</p>
<p>After laying in the provision supply that was needed, including especially
  a big can of milk packed in a barrel of cracked ice, Phil returned to the
  boat and announced his purpose of “running the falls” without a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> pilot.
  It was at supper in the cabin that he made the announcement, and Jim Hughes,
  who had been lying in his bunk with his face toward the bulkhead, suddenly
  sat up.</p>
<p>“Good!” he said. “They ain’t no use fer a pilot when the river’s bank
  full this way. When’ll you start, Phil?”</p>
<p>“Just after daylight to-morrow morning,” replied the captain.</p>
<p>“Well, I feel so much better,” said Jim, getting out of his bunk, “I think
  I’ll sample the pork and potatoes and throw in just a little o’ that hot
  corn bread and the new butter for ballast.”</p>
<p>“For a man who a few hours ago was violently ill with an intestinal disorder,”
  remarked Irv Strong a little later with a very pronounced note of sarcasm
  in his tone, “it seems to me, Jim, that you’re eating a tolerably robust
  supper. Now if I’d had the cramps you’ve been suffering from to-day, I
  really wouldn’t venture upon cabbage and potatoes boiled with salt pork.
  I’d try something ‘bland’ first, like a half pound of shot or a pig’s knuckle,
  or a bologna sausage or a few soft-boiled cobble-stones.”</p>
<p>But Jim was deaf to the sarcasm and went on eating voraciously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>“Wonder what that fellow is afraid of,” said Phil to Irv as they went
  out on deck to set the lights and make ready for the night.</p>
<p>“Don’t at all know,” responded Irv, “unless he owes money to somebody
  in Louisville. All I know is that he must have feigned that attack of cramps,
  else he couldn’t eat now in the way he does. He didn’t want to go ashore
  with you as you proposed, to hunt for a falls pilot.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed Lowry, “I’ve known all day that he was shamming, because
  he hasn’t had the slightest touch or trace of proper symptoms. Even when
  he professed to be in the most excruciating pain his pulse wasn’t in the
  least bit disturbed. I’m no doctor, but I know enough to say positively
  that a man with any such cramps as he pretended to have simply couldn’t
  have kept his pulse calmly beating seventy-two times a minute as his did.
  I timed it three times and then quit bothering with the fellow because
  I knew he was shamming.”</p>
<p>“Wonder what he meant by it,” said Will.</p>
<p>“Shoo!” said Constant; “he’s listening at the top of the gangway.”</p>
<p>“And <i>I</i> wonder what <i>that</i> means,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> Phil,
  whose alert observation of the professed pilot had never been relaxed since
  the episode at Craig’s Landing; “I wonder what he’s listening for.”</p>
<p>There was naturally no response, for the reason that nobody had anything
  to suggest. So the boys went toward the bow where the anchor-light hung,
  to hear Phil read in his newspapers all the latest details about the great
  bond robbery. They read on deck rather than in the cabin, because one boy
  must at any rate remain there on watch, and they all wished to hear.</p>
<p>The newspapers related that one of the gang of robbers was believed to
  have got away with the stolen bonds and money, and that the main purpose
  now was to find him. One man connected with the crime was already in custody,
  and from hints given by him it was hoped that he might turn state’s evidence
  in his own resentment against the “carrier of the swag,” who, it was believed,
  had deserted his fellow thieves, or some of them, and meant to keep the
  whole of the proceeds of the robbery for himself and one or two others.
  At any rate, the man in custody had given hints that were thought to be
  distinctly helpful toward the discovery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> of
  the “carrier” and his partners who had betrayed the rest of their fellows.</p>
<p>The case was very interesting, but the boys must be up early in the morning,
  so at last they broke up their little confab, and all but one of them went
  to bed. Constant Thiebaud, who first reached the ladder-head, found Jim
  Hughes seated there with his head just above the deck.</p>
<p>“I thought you were in bed long ago,” said Constant.</p>
<p>“So I was,” said Jim; “but I got restless and came out for some air.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t at all the kind of sentence that Jim Hughes was accustomed to
  frame, and the boys observed the fact. But they had got used to what Irv
  Strong called Jim’s “inadvertent lapses into grammar,” and so they went
  to their bunks without further thought of the matter.</p>
<hr class="divrule" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">JIM</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> didn’t take long to “run the falls.” From
  where the flatboat lay above Louisville to the lower end of the rapids
  was a distance of about eight or ten miles. Not only was the river bank
  full, but a great wave of additional water—a rise of four or five inches
  to the hour—struck them just as they pushed their craft out into the stream.
  There was a current of six miles an hour even as they passed the city,
  which quickened to eight or ten miles an hour when they reached the falls
  proper.</p>
<p>The boat fully justified the old pilot’s simile of a girl waltzing. She
  turned and twisted about, first one way and then the other, and now and
  then shot off in a totally new direction, toward one shore or the other,
  or straight down stream.</p>
<p>It all seemed perilous in the extreme, and at one time Jim Hughes hurriedly
  went below and brought up his carpet-bag, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> deposited
  in one of the skiffs that lay on deck.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Jim?” asked Phil, who was more and more disposed to
  watch the fellow suspiciously. “What are you doing that for?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see we mout strike a rock, and it’s best to be ready.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Phil, “but what have you got in your carpet-bag that you’re
  so careful of?” and as he asked the question he looked intently into Jim’s
  eyes, hoping to surprise there a more truthful answer than he was likely
  to get from Jim’s lips.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothin’ but my clothes,” said Jim, hastily avoiding the scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Must be a dress-suit or two among them,” said Phil, “or you’d be thinking
  less about them and more about your skin. Let’s see them!” he added suddenly,
  and offering to open the bag.</p>
<p>Jim snatched it away quickly, muttering something which the boy didn’t
  catch. But by that time the falls were passed and the flatboat was floating
  through calm waters between Portland and New Albany. So Jim retreated to
  the cabin and bestowed his precious carpet-bag again under the straw of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> his
  bunk, where he had kept it from the first.</p>
<p>“Wonder what he’s got there, Phil,” said Irv Strong, who had been attentive
  to the colloquy.</p>
<p>“Don’t know,” replied Phil; “but if things go on this way, the time will
  come when I’ll decide to find out.”</p>
<p>“By the way,” broke in Will Moreraud, “did any of you see him bring that
  carpet-bag aboard?”</p>
<p>Nobody could remember.</p>
<p>“Guess he sneaked it aboard as he did that jug,” said Phil, “and as he
  did his cramps.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be too hard on the fellow, boys,” said Ed, whose generosity was
  always apt to get the better of his judgment. “Remember he’s ignorant,
  and ignorance is always inclined to be suspicious. Probably he hasn’t more
  than a dollar’s worth or so in that carpet-bag; but as it is all he has
  in the world, he’s naturally careful of it. He’s afraid some of us will
  steal his things. If he knew more, he would know better. But he doesn’t
  know more. So he guards his poor little possessions jealously.”</p>
<p>There was silence for a minute. Then Phil said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>“See if he’s listening, Constant;” and when Constant had strolled to the
  gangway and reported “all clear,” Phil had this to say:—</p>
<p>“I’m not over-suspicious, I think. I don’t want to be unjust to anybody.
  But I’m responsible on this cruise, and it’s my duty to notice things carefully.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Irv Strong, the other “irreclaimable.” “I haven’t a
  doubt you noticed that I ate four eggs and two slices of ham for breakfast
  this morning. But before you ‘call me down’ for it, I want to say that
  I’m going to do the same thing to-morrow morning, because, since I came
  on the river, I’ve got the biggest hunger on me that I ever had in my life,
  and not at all because I have any diabolical plot in my mind to starve
  the crew of this flatboat into submission or admission or permission or
  any other sort of mission.”</p>
<p>But Phil did not smile at the pleasantry. He hesitated a moment before
  replying, as if afraid that he might say too much; for Phil, the captain,
  was a very different person from the happy-go-lucky Phil his comrades had
  hitherto known. After a little while he said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>“You remember, don’t you, that Jim Hughes wanted to ‘get down the river’
  so badly that he shipped with us without pay? If he is so poor that he
  has only that carpet-bag and only a few dollars’ worth of stuff in it,
  why didn’t he try to ‘strike’ us for some sort of wages? Does anybody here
  know where he came from, or why he came, or where he is trying to go to,
  or why he wants to go there, or in fact who he is, or anything about him?
  Can anybody explain why he shammed cramps yesterday?”</p>
<p>“To all the highly interesting questions in that competitive examination,”
  said Irv Strong, “I beg permission to answer, in words made familiar to
  one by frequent school use—‘not prepared to answer.’”</p>
<p>All the boys laughed except Phil. He was serious. The <i>boy</i> hadn’t
  at all gone out of him, as was proved by the fact that in spite of the
  October chill in the air he just then slipped off his clothes and “took
  a header” into the river. But the serious <i>man</i> had come into him
  with responsibility, as was shown by the fact that he used a towel to rub
  himself with after his bath. Having donned his clothes, he continued:—</p>
<p>“There may be nothing wrong about Jim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> Hughes.
  I don’t say there is anything wrong. But there is a good deal that is suspicious.
  So, while I accuse him of nothing, I’m watching him, and I have been watching
  him ever since we left Craig’s Landing. I don’t believe he was drunk there,
  for one thing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t believe he was drunk!” exclaimed the boys in a breath. “Why, you
  had to knock him down yourself to save the landing!”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” said Phil. “But I took pains afterward to smell his
  breath while he was supposed to be in a drunken stupor, and there wasn’t
  a trace of whiskey on it.”</p>
<p>“But you remember we found his jug hid among the freight.”</p>
<p>“You did,” replied Phil; “and you reported to me, though you may have
  forgotten the fact, that it was ‘full up to the cork.’ Those were your
  own words, Will.”</p>
<p>Will remembered, though he had not before thought of the significance
  of the fact.</p>
<p>“Well, Phil, what was the matter with him, then?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Shamming, just as he shammed the cramps yesterday.”</p>
<p>“But for what purpose?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>“I don’t know, any more than you know why he pretended to have cramps.
  My theory is that he was so anxious to get down the river that he tried
  to make us miss Craig’s Landing entirely. The sum and substance of the
  matter is this. At Craig’s Landing I wanted to put the fellow ashore. Now
  I don’t want to do anything of the kind, and I won’t either, till I can
  read a good many riddles that he has given me to puzzle over.”</p>
<p>“Can we help you to read the riddles?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Watch him closely, and tell me everything you observe, no matter
  how little it may seem to mean.”</p>
<p>Just then Jim Hughes came up out of the cabin scuttle, and all the boys
  except Phil found occasion to go to other parts of the boat. When you have
  been talking unpleasantly about another person, you naturally shrink from
  talking to him.</p>
<p>Phil, however, stood his ground. “Hello, Jim!” he called out. “How are
  the cramps, and how’s the carpet-bag? Going to try to earn your board now
  by steering a little?”</p>
<p>Jim hesitated in embarrassment. Suddenly Phil began bombarding him with
  questions like shots from a rapid-fire gun.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>“Where did you come from, anyhow, Jim? What’s your real name? What are
  you hiding from? How much do you know about the river? and about flatboating?
  Have you really ever been down the river before, or was that all a sham
  like your cramps yesterday? Who are you? What are you?”</p>
<p>Jim struggled for a moment. There was that in his face which might have
  appalled anybody but a full-blooded, resolute, dare-all boy. But he quickly
  mastered himself.</p>
<p>“See here, Phil,” he said in persuasive tones, “you’re mighty hard on
  a poor feller like me, and I don’t know why. That was a vicious clip you
  hit me at Craig’s Landing.”</p>
<p>Phil instantly responded, and again after the fashion of a breach-loader.
  “So you remember that, do you? Then you were not so drunk as you pretended.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Jim, “I was pretty full, but of course I knew who hit me.”</p>
<p>“You were not drunk at all,” said the boy. “You hadn’t even been drinking.
  I smelt of your breath, and the blow I struck didn’t knock you senseless,
  for an hour, as you pretended, or for six seconds either. Now look here,
  Jim, I don’t know what your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> purpose
  is in all this shamming, but I know for a fact that it is shamming, and
  I’ve had quite enough of it.”</p>
<p>With that the boy turned away in that profound disgust which every healthy-minded
  boy or man feels for a lie and a liar.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WONDERFUL RIVER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the “Knobs”—which is the name given to the
  high hills back of New Albany—receded, the day was still young. It was
  also overcast and cool. So Ed, who was always studying something, brought
  his big map up on deck and, spreading it out, lay down on his stomach to
  study it. He worked over it till dinner time, and in the afternoon he spread
  it out again.</p>
<p>The boys having gathered around him, he said:—</p>
<p>“I say, fellows, we are making a journey that we ought to remember as
  long as we live. We are going over a small but important part of the greatest
  river system in the world.”</p>
<p>“‘Small but important part,’” said Will, quoting. “Well, I like that.”</p>
<p>“What’s your objection,” said Ed Lowry, for the moment borrowing Irv Stron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>g’s
  playful method,—“what’s your objection to my carefully chosen descriptive
  adjectives?”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re going over pretty nearly the whole of it, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Not by any manner of means,” responded Ed. “We aren’t going over more
  than a small fraction of it.”</p>
<p>“Why, the Ohio River alone is thirteen hundred miles long,” said Will;
  “I remember that much of my geography; and most of the Mississippi lies
  below the mouth of the Ohio, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s lucky you’ve passed your geography examinations in the high school,
  Will,” said Ed. “Now come here, all you fellows, and take a look. This
  map shows the entire system of rivers of which the Mississippi is the mother.
  It is the greatest river system in the world. There is nothing, in fact,
  to compare it with but the Amazon and its tributaries, and they have never
  done anything for mankind, because they lie almost wholly in an unsettled
  and uncivilized tropical region that has no commerce and no need of any,
  while the Mississippi and its tributaries have built up an empire. They
  have in effect <i>created</i> the better part of this vast country of ours
  that is feeding the world and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>—”</p>
<p>“Oh, come now,” said Irv Strong. “You aren’t writing a composition or
  an editorial for the Vevay <i>Reveille</i>.” This was in allusion to the
  fact that Ed sometimes published “pieces” in the local newspaper.</p>
<p>“Well, no,” said Ed, laughing at his own enthusiasm. “Besides, I’ll come
  to all that some other time perhaps. At present I want to give Will some
  new ideas about the bigness of our river system. True, the Ohio is twelve
  or thirteen hundred miles long, but about half of it lies above Vevay,
  so we’re covering only six or seven hundred miles of it. From Cairo to
  New Orleans—the part of the Mississippi we shall traverse—is about one
  thousand and fifty miles long. So we’re only going to travel over sixteen
  or seventeen hundred miles of river. Now there are about fifteen or sixteen
  thousand miles of this river system that steamboats can, and actually do,
  navigate, and nobody has ever really reckoned the length of the rest—the
  parts not navigable. We’re going over only about one-tenth of the navigable
  part—one twenty-fifth part perhaps of the whole.”</p>
<p>By this time the boys were all lying prone around the big map, their feet
  radiating in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> every
  direction from it, like light-rays from a star.</p>
<p>“See here,” said Ed; “here’s the Tennessee River. It’s a mere tributary
  of the Ohio, yet it is about two-thirds as long as the main river. Its
  head waters are in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It starts
  out through Tennessee and tries, in a stupid sort of fashion, to find its
  way to the Gulf of Mexico through Alabama. But it gets discouraged by the
  mountains down there, turns back, throws a dash of water into the face
  of the state of Mississippi, returns to Tennessee and travels north clear
  across that state and Kentucky, and finally in despair gives up its effort
  to find the sea and turns the job over to the Ohio. Look at it on the map!”</p>
<p>“And as if it thought the Tennessee had more than it could do to drain
  so great a region,” said Phil, studying the map, “the Cumberland also went
  into the business and after pretty nearly paralleling its sister river
  for a great many hundreds of miles, fell into the Ohio only a few miles
  above the mouth of the Tennessee. The two together are longer than the
  Ohio itself.”</p>
<p>“Very decidedly,” said Ed. “And then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> there
  are all the other tributaries of the Ohio,—look at them on the map. Together
  they again exceed its total length.”</p>
<p>The boys looked at the map and saw that it was so. Then Ed resumed:—</p>
<p>“But, after all, the Ohio and all its tributaries combined amount to a
  very small part of the great system. The lower Mississippi itself from
  Cairo to the mouth is almost exactly as long as the Ohio. Then there are
  the upper Mississippi,—stretching clear up into Minnesota,—the Illinois,
  the Wisconsin, etc., the Missouri and its vast tributaries flowing from
  the Rocky Mountains, the Arkansas, the Red River, the Ouachita, the White,
  the St. Francis, the Yazoo, the Tallahatchie, the Sunflower, the Yalobusha—and
  a score of others, to say nothing of the vast bayous that connect with
  the wonderful river down South. Here they all are on the map. Look!”</p>
<p>The next fifteen minutes were given up to a study of the map, interested
  fingers tracing out the rivers, and a continual chatter contributing, after
  the manner of boys’ talk, to the general stock of information. Presently
  Irv Strong spoke. He had never before in his life been silent so long.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>“I remember, at this stage of the proceedings, the wise remark of our
  honored teacher, Mrs. Dupont, that ‘eyes are excellent to see with, but
  one interpretative brain means more than many additional pairs of eyes.’”</p>
<p>“What’s all that got to do with it?” asked Constant. “She was talking
  about Darwin and Spencer when she said that. What’s either of them got
  to do with this river?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Constant!” said Irv, in mock melancholy. “You grieve me to the heart.
  You never will see the inward and spiritual meaning of my outward and visible
  quotations. I mean that Ed Lowry has studied out this whole thing and knows
  ’steen times more about it and what it means than we blockheads would find
  out by studying the map for a dog’s age. I venture that assertion boldly,
  without having the remotest notion of what constitutes a dog’s age. My
  idea is that we fellows ought to shut up, though I’m personally not fond
  of doing that, and let Ed gently distil into our minds his information
  about all these things. Let’s have the benefit of the ‘interpretative brain’!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>“Let’s take a header first,” cried Phil, shedding his clothes again. “I’ll
  beat the best of you in a swim around the boat, or if I lose, I’ll wash
  the dishes for a whole day.”</p>
<p>And with that he went head foremost overboard, Will and Irv following
  him.</p>
<p>When they reappeared on deck, blowing like porpoises and glowing like
  boiled lobsters, Ed said:—</p>
<p>“You fellows are regular water-rats; Phil is, anyhow. He’s in this water
  half a dozen times a day, no matter how cold the wind is.”</p>
<p>“That’s just it,” said Phil. “The water isn’t anything like so cold as
  this October air.” Then, with mock seriousness: “Believe me, my dearly
  beloved brother, it is to escape the frigidity of the atmosphere, or, as
  it were, to warm myself, that I jump into the river. You were reading a
  poem the other day in which the stricken-spirited scribe said:—</p>
<p class="poem"> ‘For my part I wish to enjoy what I can—<br />
  A sunset, if only a sunset be near,<br />
  A moon such as this if the weather be clear,’<br />
</p>
<p>and much else to the like effect. As you read the glittering, golden words,
  I said in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> soul:
  ‘Bully for you, oh poet! I’m your man for those sentiments every time.’
  And just now the poet and I agree that nothing in this world would minister
  so much to our immediate enjoyment as to jump off the boat again on the
  larboard side, dive clear under her and come up on the starboard. Here
  goes! Who’s the poet to follow me?” And overboard the boy went, feet first
  this time, for after striking the water and sinking to a safe depth, he
  must turn himself about and swim under water for fifty or sixty feet before
  daring to come to the surface again.</p>
<p>Nobody tried to perform the feat in emulation of the reckless fellow.
  It involved a great many dangers and a still greater many of disagreeable
  possibilities such as broken heads, skinned backs, and abraded shins. Of
  that I can give my readers full assurance because I’ve done the thing myself
  many times, and bear some scars as witnesses of its risks.</p>
<p>But it was Phil’s rule of life never to let anybody “do anything in the
  swimming way” that he couldn’t do equally well. He had once seen somebody
  dive under a steamboat and come up safely on the other side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> So
  he straightway dived under the same steamboat and came up safely on the
  other side. After that, diving under a flatboat was a mere trifle to him.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WONDERFUL RIVER’S WORK</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span>, then,” said Phil, wrapping a blanket
  around his person, for the air was indeed very chill, and prostrating himself
  over the map, “now, then, let the ‘interpretative brain’ get in its work!
  I interrupted the proceedings just to take a personal observation of the
  river we are to hear all about. Go on, Ed!”</p>
<p>“Wait a bit—I’m counting,” said Ed; “twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven,
  twenty-eight. There. If you’ll look at the map, you’ll see that the water
  which the Mississippi carries down to the sea through a channel about half
  a mile wide below New Orleans, comes from twenty-eight states besides the
  Indian Territory.”</p>
<p>“What! oh, nonsense!” were the exclamations that greeted this statement.</p>
<p>“Look, and count for yourselves,” said Ed, pointing to various parts of
  the map<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> as
  he proceeded. “Here they are: New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia,
  North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
  Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota,
  South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas,
  Louisiana, Texas, and the Indian Territory. Very little comes from New
  York or South Carolina or Texas, and not a great deal from some others
  of the states named, but some does, as you will see by following up the
  lines on the map. The rest of the states mentioned send the greater part
  of all their rainfall to the sea by this route.”</p>
<p>“Well, you could at this moment knock me down with a feather,” said Irving
  Strong. “Aren’t you glad, Phil, that we jumped in away up here before the
  water got such a mixing up?”</p>
<p>“But that isn’t the most important part of it,” said Ed, after his companions
  had finished their playful discussion of the subject.</p>
<p>“What is it, then? Go on,” said Irv. “I’m all ears, though Mrs. Dupont
  always thought I was all tongue. What is the most important part of it,
  Ed?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why, that this river <i>created</i> most of the states it drains.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Why, I mean that but for this great river system it would have taken
  a hundred or more years longer than it did to settle this vastest valley
  on earth and build it up into great, populous states that produce the best
  part of the world’s food supply.”</p>
<p>“Go on, please,” said Will Moreraud, speaking the eager desire of all.</p>
<p>“You see,” said Ed, “in order to settle a country and bring it into cultivation,
  you must have some way of getting into it, and still more, you must have
  some way of getting the things it produces out of it, so as to sell them
  to people that need them. Nobody would have taken the trouble to raise
  the produce we now have on board this boat, for instance,—the hay, grain,
  flour, apples, cornmeal, onions, potatoes, and the rest,—if there had been
  no way of sending the things away and selling them somewhere. Unless there
  is a market within reach, nobody will produce more of anything than he
  can himself use.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” said Irv. “That’s why I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> don’t
  think more than I do. I’ve no market for my crop of thoughts.”</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken there,” said Constant, who was slow of speech and usually
  had little to say. “There’s always a market for thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Right around you. What did we go into this flatboat business for except
  to be with Ed? He can’t do half as much as any one of us at an oar, or
  at anything else except thinking, and yet we would never have come on this
  voyage—”</p>
<p>“Oh, dry up!” said Ed, seeing the compliment that was impending. “I was
  going to say—”</p>
<p>“And so was I going to say,” said Constant; “and, in fact, I <i>am</i> going
  to say. What I’m going to say is that there isn’t a fellow here who would
  be here but for you, Ed. There isn’t a fellow here that wouldn’t be glad
  to do all of your share of the work, if Phil would let him, just for the
  sake of hearing what you think. Anyhow, that’s why Constant Thiebaud is
  a member of this crew.”</p>
<p>It was the longest speech that Constant Thiebaud had ever been known to
  make,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> and
  it was the most effective one he could have made, because it put into words
  the thought that was in every one’s mind. That is the very essence of oratory
  and of effective writing. All the great speeches in the world have been
  those that cleverly expressed the thought and the feeling of those who
  listened. All the great books have been those that said for the vast, dumb
  multitudes that which was in their minds and souls vainly longing for utterance.</p>
<p>When Constant had finished, there was silence for a moment. Then Irv Strong
  said impressively:—</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Amen!</span>”</p>
<p>That exclamation ended the silence, and expressed the common sentiment
  of all who were present. For even Jim Hughes, who was listening, had begun
  to be interested.</p>
<p>Ed was embarrassed, of course, and for the first time in his life words
  completely failed him. He sat up; then he grasped Constant’s hand, and
  said, “I thank you, fellows.” And with that he retreated hurriedly to the
  cabin for a little while.</p>
<p>Constant went to the pump, and labored hard for a time to draw water from
  a bilge that had no leak. Will went to inspect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> anchor,
  as if he feared that something might be the matter with it. Phil and Irving
  jumped overboard, and swam twice around the boat.</p>
<p>Finally, all came on deck again, and Will said:—</p>
<p>“Go on, Ed. We want to hear.”</p>
<p>Ed at once resumed, Jim Hughes meantime working with the steering-oar.</p>
<p>“Well, this great river gave the people who came over the mountains, and
  afterward the people who came up it from New Orleans, not only an outlet
  to the sea, but a sort of public road, over which they could travel and
  trade with each other. When the upper Ohio region began to be settled,
  a great swarm of emigrants from the East poured over the mountains, and
  made a highway of the river to get themselves and all that belonged to
  them to the upper Mississippi, the lower Mississippi, and the Missouri
  River country. My father once told me, before he died, that in his boyhood
  you could tell a steamboat bound from Pittsburg or Cincinnati to St. Louis
  from any other boat, because she was red all over with ploughs, wagons,
  and all that sort of thing. Agricultural implements were all painted red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> in
  those days, and as they weren’t very heavy freight they were bestowed all
  over the boat,—on the boiler deck guards, on the hurricane deck, and sometimes
  were in the cabin, and on top of the Texas.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Now,
  without these ploughs, wagons, harrows, and so forth, how could the pioneers
  ever have brought the great Western country under cultivation? And without
  the river how could they ever have got these necessary implements, or themselves,
  for that matter, to the regions where they were needed?”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t they have taken them overland?”</p>
<p>“Only in a very small and slow way. There were no railroads, no turnpikes,
  and even no dirt roads at that time. It would have cost ten times more
  to take a wagonload of ploughs through the woods and across the prairies,
  from Pittsburg or Cincinnati to Missouri or Iowa, than the wagon and the
  ploughs put together were worth when they got there. But the river came
  to the rescue. It carried the people and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> their
  belongings cheaply and quickly, and then it carried their produce to New
  Orleans; and so the great West was settled.</p>
<p>“In the meantime the people in Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and other towns
  saw that they could make all the wagons, ploughs, and other things wanted
  by the people further west much cheaper than the same things could be sent
  over the mountains from the East. Thus, factories and foundries sprang
  up, new farms were opened and new towns built.”</p>
<p>“Were there steamboats from the first?” asked one of the boys.</p>
<p>“No; when Vevay was settled, Fulton hadn’t yet built the first steamboat
  that ever travelled, and when steamboats did appear they were few and small.
  Flatboats, just like this one, carried most of the produce to New Orleans;
  but as flatboats couldn’t come back up the river, there were a good many
  keelboats that brought freight and passengers up as well as down stream.”</p>
<p>“What are keelboats?”</p>
<p>“Why, they were large barges built with a keel, a sharp bow, and a modelled
  stern—in short, like a steamboat’s hull. These keelboats floated down the
  river, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> men
  then pushed them back up stream with long poles. When the current was too
  strong for that they got out on the bank and hauled the boat by ropes.
  That was called ‘cordelling.’ The steamboats grew, however, in number and
  size when they came, and as long ago as 1835 there were more than three
  hundred of them on the Mississippi alone. In 1850 there were more than
  four thousand on these rivers. They drove the keelboats out of business,
  but the flatboats continued because of their cheapness till after the Civil
  War, when the great towboats came into use. These, with their acres of
  barges, could carry freight even cheaper than flatboats could. For a long
  time the steamboats carried all the passengers, too, and many of them were
  palaces in magnificence. But the railroads came at last and took the passenger
  business away, and much of the freight traffic also, because they are faster,
  and still more because they don’t have to go so far to get anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Why, how’s that? I don’t understand,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Yes, you do, if you’ll think a bit,” responded Ed.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t <i>think</i> of thinking. I’m too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> tired
  or too lazy so tell me,” was Irv’s rejoinder.</p>
<p>“Well, you know the river is crooked, and the steamboats must follow all
  its windings, while the railroads can run nearly straight.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” said Irv, “but the crookedness of the river isn’t enough
  to make any very great difference.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? Well, down in Chicot County, Arkansas, there is one bend in
  the river so big that from the upper landing on a plantation to the lower
  landing on the same plantation, the distance by river is seventeen miles,
  while you can walk across the neck from one landing to the other in less
  than a mile and a half!”</p>
<p>“Whew!” said Phil. “And are there many such trips round Robin Hood’s barn
  for us to make on the way down?”</p>
<p>“That’s best answered by telling you that from Cairo to New Orleans the
  distance by river is about one thousand and fifty miles, while by rail
  it is a little over four hundred miles. But come. It’s getting dark, and
  I’ve got to bake some corn pones for supper, so I must quit lecturing.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THE TERROR OF THE RIVER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the next few days the voyage was uneventful.
  There was very little to be done at the sweeps—only now and then a ten
  minutes’ pull to keep the boat off the banks and in the river. For the
  water was now so high that there was no such thing as a channel to be followed.</p>
<p>In many places the stream had overflowed its banks and flooded the country
  for miles inland on either side. Sometimes a strong current would set toward
  the points where the water was going over the banks, and a constant watchfulness
  was necessary to prevent the boat from being drawn into these currents
  and “going off for a trip in the country,” as Irv Strong expressed it.
  Whenever she manifested a disposition of that kind, all hands worked hard
  at the sweeps till she was carried out of the danger.</p>
<p>During these days Ed read a great deal, and the other boys read a little
  and talked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> not
  a little. On one or two days there were heavy all-day rains, and at such
  times Ed would have liked to remain in the cabin when not needed at the
  sweeps, and the other boys, hearing him cough so frequently, pleaded with
  Phil to let him stay under cover.</p>
<p>“We never really need him for rowing,” said they, “and he ought to stay
  down below all the time when it’s wet, for the sake of his health.”</p>
<p>“That’s just where you differ in opinion from the doctor,” responded Phil.
  “<i>He</i> says I’m to keep Ed in the open air on deck all the time. Air
  is his only medicine, the doctor insists, and I’m going to give him his
  medicine, for I’ve made up my mind to take him back to Vevay a much ‘weller’
  fellow than he’s ever been before. So on with your rubber goods, Ed, and
  out with you!”</p>
<p>“You’re entirely right, Phil,” said the elder brother. “And I’m much ‘weller,’
  as you call it, already. I don’t cough so much or so hard as I did. I sleep
  better and eat better and feel stronger. I guess I’ve been too much taken
  care of.”</p>
<p>“Oh, as to that, I expect to make an athlete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> of
  you yet,” said Phil. Then turning to Irving, with moisture in his eyes,
  as Ed mounted to the deck, he added: “I don’t know, Irv, but I’m doing
  what the doctor told me was best. It <i>hurts</i> me, but I do it for <i>his</i> sake.”</p>
<p>“Of course you do. And of course it’s best, too. Ed really is getting
  better. I’ve watched him closely.”</p>
<p>“Have you?” asked Phil, eagerly. “And are you sure he’s getting better?
  Oh, are you <i>sure</i>?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am,” said Irv, beginning to feel the necessity of lapsing
  into light chatter to escape an emotional crisis. “Of course I am. Why,
  haven’t you noticed that since we ran out of milk and sugar he’s drunk
  his coffee clear like an honest flatboatman? And haven’t you noticed that
  he rebukes my ignorance and your juvenility with a vigor that no really
  ill fellow could bring to bear? He’s all right—Look!” as the two emerged
  on deck. “He’s actually trying to teach Jim Hughes how to splice a rope!
  Nobody but a man full of robust energy to the bursting point would ever
  try to teach that dullard anything.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>“He isn’t a dullard,” replied Phil. “He shams all that, I tell you.”</p>
<p>Irv didn’t argue the point. He didn’t care anything about it. He had accomplished
  his purpose. He had diverted Phil’s and his own thoughts, and prevented
  the little emotional breakdown that had been so imminent.</p>
<p>Why is it that boys are so ashamed of that which is best and noblest in
  their natures?</p>
<p>They were nearing Cairo now, and there was no time for further talk. With
  the river at its present stage, and with a high wind blowing, and a heavy
  rain almost blinding them, it was not an easy thing to get their boat safely
  into the pocket between Cairo and Mound City, amid the scores and hundreds
  of coal barges that were harboring there. For the flatboat even to touch
  one of the coal barges, unless very gently indeed, meant the instant sinking
  of many hundreds of tons of coal, and in all probability, the loss of the
  flatboat also.</p>
<p>At one time Phil—for he had ceased to think of Jim as a pilot, or even
  as a person who could lend any but merely muscular assistance anywhere—was
  on the point of giving up the idea of landing at all. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> debated
  with himself whether it would not be wiser to float on past Cairo, into
  the Mississippi. But the boat was really very short of provisions. The
  milk supply had given out two days after passing the falls; their meal
  was almost exhausted; their salt had got wet; they had no butter left;
  there was only half a pound of coffee in their canister; and no flour whatever
  remained. There was a little bacon in their cargo, and there were flour,
  eggs, cornmeal, onions, and potatoes also. But it was their agreed purpose
  not to risk complications in their accounts by taking any of their cargo
  for their own use except in case of extreme necessity.</p>
<p>“And as for eggs,” said Irv Strong, “I fear that those in our cargo are
  beginning to be too far removed from the original source of supply,—too
  remotely connected with the hens of Switzerland County, Indiana, as it
  were,—too—well, they seem to me far more likely to give satisfaction to
  educated palates in New Orleans ‘omelettes with onions’ and the like, than
  on our frugal table. Besides, our cabin is rather small and it would be
  troublesome to have to go up on deck every time the cook wanted to break
  an egg.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>“You forget, Irv,” said Ed, “we aren’t more than ten or twelve days out
  yet, and eggs keep pretty well for a much longer time than that.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Irv; “but it seems to me that we’ve been on the river for
  a month. At any rate, Phil’s plan of not eating up our cargo is a good
  one.”</p>
<p>Between Cairo and Memphis lay about two hundred and forty miles of difficult
  river, and in all that distance there was not a town of any consequence,
  at least as a market in which to buy boat stores. So the necessity of landing
  at Cairo for supplies overrode all considerations of difficulty and danger
  in the young captain’s mind, and after some very hard work and some narrow
  escapes, he succeeded in securely tying up <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> in
  the bend.</p>
<p>During their stay at Cairo Jim Hughes was again ill, afflicted this time
  with chills and fever. But he angrily refused to have a doctor called,
  and as Ed could find no trouble with his pulse or temperature, the crew
  did not insist upon summoning medical assistance.</p>
<p>“Let’s put him ashore and be rid of him,” suggested Will Moreraud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, let’s!” said Constant. “He’s of no use to us, and he spoils the
  party by his presence.”</p>
<p>“No,” decided Phil, “I wanted to put him ashore at Craig’s Landing, but
  I’ve got over that desire. He interests me now in his way. I’ve discovered
  a good deal about him, and I mean to find out more. He’s going somewhere,
  and I want to find out where it is. No, boys, we’ll keep him on board for
  a while.”</p>
<p>At Cairo Phil bought a large supply of newspapers from Chicago, St. Louis,
  Memphis, and New Orleans. They reported increasing floods in every direction.
  The upper Mississippi was at a tremendous stage. The Missouri was pouring
  a vast flood into it. The Tennessee and Cumberland were adding enormously
  every hour to the great volume of water that was pouring down out of the
  overflowed and still swelling Ohio. In short, one of those great Mississippi
  floods was at hand which come only when all the rivers—those from north,
  west, east, and south—“run out” at the same time.</p>
<p>The river was full of drift; great uprooted trees and timbers from houses
  and barns that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> had
  been swept from their foundations and reduced to wreckage; driftwood from
  thousands of miles of shore. Flotsam of every conceivable kind covered
  the face of the waters so completely that it looked as if one might almost
  walk across, stepping from one floating mass to another.</p>
<p>And there was a menace in it, too, that was ever present. The uprooted
  trees refused to float steadily. They turned over and over like giants
  troubled in their sleep with Titanic nightmares. They lashed their wide-reaching
  limbs in fury, while currents and cross-currents caused the floating stuff
  to rush hither and thither, now piling it high and grinding it together
  with destructive energy, now scattering it again and leaving great water
  spaces clear.</p>
<p>Now and then a house or a barn would float by, crushed half out of shape,
  but not yet twisted into its original materials. Altogether the river presented
  a spectacle that would have inspired any old Greek poet’s imagination to
  create a dozen new gods and a score of hitherto unknown demons to serve
  as the directors of it all.</p>
<p>So <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> tarried in the bend above Cairo, waiting
  for the worst of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> the
  drift to run by before again venturing upon the bosom of the great flood.</p>
<p>“I say, Ed,” said Phil, looking out upon the vast waste of water with
  its seething surface of wreckage, “nothing in all that you have told us
  about the river has given me so good an idea of its tremendous power as
  the sight of that,”—waving his hand toward the stream.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” replied the elder. “Nothing that anybody could say in
  a lifetime could equal that demonstration of power. Nobody that ever lived
  could put this wonderful river into words. I have told you fellows only
  of the good it has done—only of its beneficence. You see now what power
  of malignity and destructiveness it has. This single flood has already
  destroyed hundreds of lives and swept away scores and hundreds of homes,
  and obliterated millions of dollars’ worth of property. Before it is over
  the hundreds in each case will be multiplied into thousands. Even now,
  right here at Cairo, a great disaster impends. Every able-bodied man in
  the town has been sent with pick or shovel or wheelbarrow to work night
  and day in strengthening and raising the levees. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> are
  ten thousand people in this town. With the Mississippi on one side and
  the Ohio on the other, and with their floods united across country above
  the town, these helpless people have nothing in the world but an embankment
  of earth between them and death. Their homes lie from twenty to thirty
  feet below the level of the water that surrounds them on every side. And
  that level is rising every hour, every minute. It is already several inches
  above the top of their permanent levees. The flood is held in check only
  by a temporary earthwork, built on top of the permanent one. It is no wonder
  that the embankments are ablaze with torches and that a thousand men are
  working ceaselessly by night and by day to build the barriers higher.”</p>
<p>“What if a levee should break?” asked Will, in awe.</p>
<p>“Ten thousand people would be drowned in ten minutes,” answered Phil,
  who had been studying the matter even more closely than Ed had done. “Cairo
  lies now in a triangle, with the floods on all three sides. If the levee
  should give way at any point on any side, Niagara itself would be a mere
  brook compared with the torrent that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> rush
  into the town. One of the engineers said to me to-day that the pressure
  upon the levees at this stage of water amounts to thousands of millions
  of tons. Should there be a break at any point, it would give to all this
  ocean of water a sudden chance to fall thirty feet or so. Now think what
  that would mean! The engineer, when I asked him, answered,—‘Well, it would
  mean that in ten minutes the whole city of Cairo would be swept completely
  off the face of the earth. Not only would no building be left standing
  in the town, but there would be literally not one stone or brick left on
  top of another. Indeed, the very land on which the city stands, the entire
  point, would be scooped out fifty feet below its present level and carried
  bodily away into the river. The site of the town would lie far beneath
  the surface of the water.’”</p>
<p>“And all this may happen at any moment now?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Phil. “But it is not likely, and brave men are fighting with
  all their might to prevent it. Let us hope they will succeed.”</p>
<p>“Why do people live in such a place?” asked Will.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why do men live and plant vineyards high up on the slopes of Vesuvius,
  knowing all the time the story of what happened to Herculaneum and Pompeii?”
  asked Irv.</p>
<p>“It’s sometimes because they must, because they have nowhere else to live.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed, “but it is oftener because they have the courage to face
  danger for the sake of bettering themselves or their children in one way
  or another. Did it ever occur to you that all that is worth while in human
  achievement has been accomplished by the men who, for the sake of an advantage
  of one kind or another, were willing to risk their lives, encounter danger
  in any form, however appalling, endure hardships of the most fearful character,
  and take risks immeasurable? That is the sort of men that in frail ships
  sailed over the seas to America and conquered and settled this country,
  fighting Indians and fevers and famines and all the rest of it. It was
  that sort of men,—and women, too,—for don’t forget that in all those enterprises
  the women risked as much as the men did and suffered vastly more,—it was
  that sort of men and women who pushed over the mountains and built up this
  great West of ours. Talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> about
  the heroism of war! why, all the wars in all the world never brought out
  so much of really exalted heroism as that displayed by a single company
  of pioneer emigrants from Virginia or North Carolina, crossing the mountains
  into Kentucky, Tennessee, or Indiana.”</p>
<p>“Then these Cairo people are heroes in their way?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Ed, “though they don’t know it. Heroes never do. The hero
  is the man who, in pursuit of any worthy purpose,—though it be only to
  make more money for the support of his family,—calmly faces the risks,
  endures the hardships, and performs the tasks that fall to his lot. The
  highest courage imaginable is that which prompts a man to do his duty as
  he understands it, with absolute disregard of consequences to himself.”</p>
<p>That night Phil read his newspapers very diligently. Especially, he studied
  the portraits and the minute descriptions given of the man who was “carrying”
  the proceeds of the great bank robbery. Somehow, Phil was becoming more
  and more deeply interested in that subject.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">IN THE HOME OF THE EARTHQUAKES</p>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night soon after <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> left
  Cairo, Phil’s compass showed that the Mississippi River, whose business
  it was to run toward the south, was in fact running due north. Phil recognized
  this as one of the vagaries of the wonderful river. Consulting his map,
  he found that the river knew its business, that the boat was in New Madrid
  Bend, where for a space the strangely erratic river runs north, only to
  turn again to its southerly course, after having asserted its liberty by
  running in a contrary direction as it does at Cairo, where a line drawn
  due north from the southerly point of Illinois cuts through a part of Kentucky,
  a state lying to the south of Illinois. No ordinary map shows this, but
  it is nevertheless true. Illinois ends in a hook, which extends so far
  south and so far east as to bring a part of Illinois to the southward of
  Kentucky.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>Phil had fully grasped this fact. He had reconciled himself to the eccentricities
  of the wonderful river, and was entirely content to float northward, so
  long as that seemed to be the river’s will.</p>
<p>But about midnight there came a disturbance. First of all there was a
  great roar, as of artillery or Titanic trains of cars somewhere in the
  centre of the earth. Then there were severe blows upon the bottom of the
  flatboat, blows that threatened to break its gunwales in two. Then three
  great waves came up the river, curling over the flatboat’s bow and pouring
  their floods into her hold, as if to swamp her. Then the boat swung around,
  changed her direction, and for a time ran up the stream, while waves threatened
  at every moment to overwhelm her.</p>
<p>Phil, who was on watch at the time, ran to the scuttle to call his comrades,
  but there was no occasion. The tremendous thumps on the bottom of the boat
  and the swaying of everything backward and forward had awakened them, and,
  half clad, they were rushing on deck.</p>
<p>Just then the boat struck upon a shore bar and went hard aground. The
  water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> that
  had come in over her bow had more than filled the bilge; but how far the
  disturbance had made the boat leak, Phil could not find out, for she was
  now resting upon a sandbank near the shore, and of course, supported as
  she was by the river bottom, she could not settle farther. So Phil ordered
  all hands to the pumps, in order to get out the wave water, and to find
  out as soon as she should float again what water there might be coming
  in through leaks caused by the disturbance just experienced.</p>
<p>A little pumping showed that the boat was not leaking seriously. The water
  in the hold went down in about the same proportion that the pumps poured
  it out, thus showing that no additional supply was coming in anywhere.</p>
<p>In half an hour the pumps ceased to “draw.” That is to say, no water came
  out in response to their activity. But the flatboat was still aground.</p>
<p>“Never mind about that,” said Irv Strong. “The river is still rising rapidly,
  and it will soon float us.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Phil, “if we are on a level bar and if the boat has undergone
  no strain. You see as long as we have bottom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> under
  us, we shan’t leak to any serious extent. But when we float again, the
  great weight of our cargo will make every open seam admit water to its
  full capacity.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Irv. “But what makes you think there are any open seams?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” answered Phil, “except a general impulse of precaution. We
  went aground very easily. In fact, I didn’t know we were aground till I
  saw the water flowing by, and by the way, it is <span class="smcap">RUNNING
  UP STREAM</span>!” As he said this he leaned over the side and observed
  the water carefully.</p>
<p>The other boys joined him and observed the same phenomenon, largely in
  wonder, but almost half in fright. The Mississippi River was unquestionably
  running the wrong way, and that, too, when a great flood was pouring down
  it and seeking its way to the sea.</p>
<p>“What does it all mean, Ed?” asked Will Moreraud. “Tell us about it, for
  of course you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether I know or not,” responded Ed, with more of hesitation
  than was usual in his tone. “I think we have had a small earthquake. We
  are in the midst of a region of small earthquakes. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> are
  in New Madrid Bend, and for the best part of a century that has been a
  sort of earthquake nest.”</p>
<p>“The river is running down stream again,” called out Constant, “and we
  are beginning to float, too.”</p>
<p>“So we are,” said Irv Strong, going to the side and inspecting. “Let’s
  go below and find out whether or not we’re leaking.”</p>
<p>The suggestion was a timely one. Phil indeed had anticipated it, and when
  his comrades went below they found him there with a lantern, minutely inspecting
  every point where incoming water might be looked for.</p>
<p>Their search clearly revealed the fact that the flatboat—which was now
  again floating down the stream—was not leaking more than she did ordinarily,
  not so much that a few minutes’ pumping now and then could not keep her
  bilge empty.</p>
<p>Having satisfied themselves of the boat’s safety, the boys returned to
  the deck, and renewed their demands upon Ed for an explanation.</p>
<p>“Well, you see,” said Ed, “we’re in New Madrid Bend. Now, as I said a
  while ago, for the best part of a century, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> for
  all the centuries before that, this region has been the home of earthquakes,
  not very great ones, but such as we have just experienced. Along about
  1811 and 1812 it was distressed with much severer ones in an uncommon degree.
  We have just had the Mississippi River running up stream for five or ten
  minutes as a result of one of these disturbances. In 1811 it ran up stream
  for three full days and nights. Great fissures were opened in the earth
  all over the country round about, and as they always, or at least generally,
  ran north and south, the settlers used to fell trees east and west, and
  build their cabins upon them, so that they might not be swallowed up by
  the earthquakes.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t they run away from so appalling a danger?” asked Irv Strong.</p>
<p>“Because they were pioneers,” answered Ed, “because they were the sort
  of heroes we were talking about at Cairo, men who took all the risks that
  might come to them in order that they might secure advantages to themselves
  and their children. Men of that sort do not run away from earthquakes,
  any more than they run away from Indians, or fevers, or floods, or any
  other dangers. And by the way, these same people had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> Indians
  to contend with, in their very ugliest moods.”</p>
<p>“How so?” asked two of the boys at once.</p>
<p>“Why, in the time of the great earthquakes, all of Western Tennessee and
  Kentucky, and the greater part of Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama were
  inhabited by savage Choctaws, Cherokees, Creeks, and other hostile tribes.
  At that time the great Indiana chief, Tecumseh, conceived his plan of uniting
  all the tribes from Indiana—then a part of the Northwest Territory—to Mississippi,
  Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida, in a league for determined
  resistance to the westward advance of the whites.</p>
<p>“It was an opportune time, for a little later the British, being at war
  with us, came to Florida and undertook to form an offensive and defensive
  alliance with the Indians, whom they supplied with guns and ammunition,
  for the destruction of the United States. And but for Jackson’s superb
  war against the Creeks, and later his victory at New Orleans, they would
  have succeeded in splitting this country in two.</p>
<p>“When Tecumseh went south to secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> the
  coöperation of the Creeks, Choctaws, and Seminoles in this plan for the
  destruction of our country, he told the Muscogees that on his return to
  the north he would ‘stamp his foot’ and they would feel the earth tremble.</p>
<p>“The New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812, which extended into Alabama
  and Georgia, came just in time to fulfil this prophetic threat, and there
  is no doubt that they played a great part in provoking the most dangerous
  Indian war this country ever knew—the most dangerous because, before it
  was over, there came to our shores a great British army, the flower of
  English soldiery, under command of Pakenham, Wellington’s most trusted
  lieutenant—to capture New Orleans and secure control of our wonderful river,
  and all the region west of it.”</p>
<p>“And why didn’t they do it?” asked Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“Because of Andrew Jackson,” answered Ed. “He went to New Orleans to meet
  them. He had no army, but he created one mostly in a single afternoon.
  His only experienced troops were three hundred Tennessee volunteers under
  Coffee, one of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> old
  Indian fighters. But he had some backwoods volunteers, and he enlisted
  all the merchants he could in New Orleans, and all their clerks, all the
  ragamuffins of the city, all the wharf rats, and all the free negroes there,
  and armed them as best he could. Half of Pakenham’s force had moved from
  Lake Borgue to a point a few miles below the city. Without waiting for
  a force fit to fight them with, Jackson cried ‘Forward’ to his motley collection
  of men, and on the night of December 23, 1814, he attacked the great veteran
  English army in the dark. It was a fearful fight, and the vigor of it and
  its insolence as a military operation so appalled the British, that they
  waited for more than two weeks for the rest of their forces to come up
  before trying again to capture the city,—a thing which they had intended
  to do the next morning without the loss of a man. In the meantime, Jackson
  had fortified himself, and reënforcements had come to him, so that when
  the British were at last ready, on the 8th of January, 1815, to advance
  to what they still expected to be the easy conquest of the city, they were
  ‘licked out of their boots.’ That, in brief, is the story of the battle
  which for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> the
  second time decided American independence. For the British in the War of
  1812-14 had nothing less in view than the re-conquest of our country, and
  the restoration of the states to the condition and status of British colonies.”</p>
<p>“But how about the earthquakes?” asked Irv; “why is this region subject
  to them more than others?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that I know,” said Ed. “But countries in the neighborhood
  of volcanoes are usually either peculiarly subject to earthquakes or especially
  exempt from them. It seems that sometimes the volcanoes act as safety valves,
  while sometimes they don’t work in that way till after the region round
  about has been greatly shaken up, preparatory to an eruption.”</p>
<p>“But what have volcanoes got to do with New Madrid Bend?” asked Phil.
  “There aren’t any volcanoes in the United States.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ed, thoughtfully; “but there are some hot springs over in Arkansas,
  not very far from here, and they are volcanic of course in their origin
  and character. Perhaps if the Arkansas hot springs were a robust volcano,
  instead of being what they are, there would not be so many earthquakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> in
  this part of the country. If they threw out stones and lava and let off
  steam generally as Vesuvius and Etna and the others do, perhaps this part
  of the country wouldn’t have so many agues.”</p>
<p>Just then the boat heeled over, the river was broken into great waves
  again, and all creation seemed to be see-sawing north and south. Phil called
  the boys to the sweeps, as a matter of precaution, but the boat was helpless
  in the raging river. She was driven ashore again; that is to say, she was
  driven over the brink of a submerged river bank, where she stuck securely
  in the mud.</p>
<p>This second earthquake did not last more than thirty or forty seconds,
  but that was long enough to get <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> into the
  worst trouble that she had yet encountered. She seemed to be bending in
  the middle as if resting upon a fallen tree with both ends free.</p>
<p>Phil quickly manned the skiffs and instituted an inspection. By the use
  of poles and lead lines he soon discovered that two-thirds of the boat’s
  length lay upon a reasonably level bank, the remaining third overhanging
  it. It was this that was bending her so dangerously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>“Get inside, boys, quick,” he called to his comrades. “The boat’s bow
  overhangs the bank. We must get all the freight out of it as quickly as
  possible.”</p>
<p>Then in brief sentences he gave his commands.</p>
<p>“Roll those apple barrels into the cabin! Carry those bags of meal on
  deck and well astern! Take the anchor there, too! Lighten the bow all you
  can!”</p>
<p>The boys worked like beavers, and after a while the entire forward part
  of the boat was free of freight. The cabin as a consequence was full, and
  the deck so piled up with bags and barrels that ordinary navigation would
  have been impossible. But at any rate, the danger of breaking the boat
  in two was averted.</p>
<p>Phil then got into a skiff with Irv, and armed with some lanterns, went
  carefully all around the boat, measuring depths and looking for possibly
  open seams or other damage. When he returned to the deck he reported:—</p>
<p>“We are lying in about six inches of Missouri mud with two and a half
  feet of water above it, trespassing to that extent upon somebody’s farm.
  But the reports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> from
  up the rivers when we were at Cairo were that at least twelve inches more
  water might be expected within forty-eight hours, and as it is raining
  like Noah’s flood now, and we only need a few inches of water to set us
  free, we’ll be afloat again by morning if we don’t have another earthquake
  to send us still farther out into the country.”</p>
<p>The event justified Phil’s prediction. About five o’clock in the morning
  the flatboat floated again, and with a few vigorous strokes of the sweeps
  she was sent out into the middle of the river. Then Phil gave orders for
  the restoration of the freight to its proper place. Not until that was
  done was it possible to get breakfast, for the cabin had been piled full
  of freight, and when it was done, Phil devoted himself for an hour or more,
  before he would eat, to an inspection of the boat. He found and stopped
  a few leaks that had been made by the strain, which had caused the oakum
  to loosen in the seams.</p>
<p>The rain continuing, the boys had a dull day of it, but at any rate their
  boat was in good condition, and was now again floating down stream toward
  her destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">IN THE CHUTE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Below</span> New Madrid the swollen river was so full
  that only the line of trees on either side indicated its borders. In many
  places it had so completely overflowed its banks that it was forty or fifty
  miles wide in fact. In other places, where the banks were high, the river
  was confined for brief spaces within its natural limits, and rushed forward
  with the speed of water in a mill-race.</p>
<p>The driftwood had by this time largely run out, and while there was still
  much of it in the river, its presence no longer involved any particular
  danger. Still, it was necessary to observe it; and it was especially necessary
  to keep a close watch on the boat’s course, lest she should be drawn into
  some bayou or pocket, where danger would impend.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the boys had considerable leisure, and Ed devoted a good
  deal of the time, at their request, to expounding to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> them
  all the lore that he had gathered from his books. One day he brought out
  his map again, and got them interested in it until they lost sight of other
  things around them. For that matter, Jim Hughes was on the steering-bridge,
  and was supposed to be directing the course of the boat. It was his duty,
  of course, to call attention to anything that might need attention; so
  the boys allowed themselves to become absorbed in Ed’s explanations and
  in their own study of the map.</p>
<p>It was about sunset when Phil raised himself and took a look ahead. He
  suddenly sprang to his feet and called out hurriedly, but not excitedly,
  “Starboard sweep, boys.”</p>
<p>He himself ran to the steering-oar, and, in spite of some remonstrance
  from the pilot, took possession of it.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Jim,” he called out, “running us into this chute?
  Give it to her, boys, with all your might.”</p>
<p>But it was of no use. It was too late. The boat had already been driven
  into the chute behind an island, and must now go through it. Jim Hughes
  had successfully managed that.</p>
<p>A chute is that part of the river which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> lies
  between an island and the shore nearest to it. At low water, the chutes
  in the Mississippi are not usually navigable at all. But when the river
  is high, they are deep enough and wide enough for a steamboat to pass through;
  and, as passing through the chute usually saves many miles of distance
  against a strong current, the steamboats going up the stream always “run
  the chute” when they can. But as these chutes are rarely wide enough, even
  in the highest water, for two boats to pass each other safely within them,
  the law forbids boats going down the river to run them at all.</p>
<p>Phil had been instructed in all this by Perry Raymond, and he was therefore
  much disturbed when he found the flatboat hopelessly involved in the head
  of the chute.</p>
<p>He explained in short, crisp, snappy sentences to his fellows the violation
  of law they were committing, and the danger there was of snags, fallen
  trees and other obstructions, in running the chute under the most favorable
  circumstances.</p>
<p>But he was in for it now, and there was only one thing to be done. Go
  through the chute he must. The problem was to get through it as quickly
  and as safely as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> possible.
  If he could get through it without meeting any up-coming steamer and without
  running the boat afoul of any snags or other obstructions, all would be
  well enough, except that it would still leave Jim Hughes’s action unexplained
  and puzzling. Should he meet a steamboat in the narrow passage, he must
  take the consequences, whatever they might happen to be. He kept the boys
  continually at the sweeps, in order to give him good steerage way; and
  earnestly adjured them to be alert, and to act instantly on any order he
  might give, to all of which they responded with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“How long is this chute, Jim?”</p>
<p>“How do I know?” answered that worthy, or more properly, that unworthy.</p>
<p>“I thought you knew the river. You shipped as a pilot,” said the boy.
  “Hard on the starboard, boys; hard on the starboard! There, that’ll do.
  Let her float now!”</p>
<p>Then turning to Jim, he said again:—</p>
<p>“You shipped as a pilot. You pretended to know the river. Probably you
  do know it better than you now pretend. You deliberately ran us into this
  channel. You did it on purpose. You must know the chute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> then.
  What did you do it for? What do you mean by it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I shipped as a pilot,” answered the surly fellow, “but I shipped
  without pay, you will remember. I was careful to assume no obligation for
  which I could be held responsible in law.”</p>
<p>Phil started back in amazement. Neither the sentence nor the assured forethought
  that lay behind it fitted at all the character of the ignorant lout that
  the man who spoke had pretended to be. Phil now clearly saw that all this
  man’s pretences had been false, that his character and his personality
  had been assumed, and that, for some purpose known only to himself, the
  fellow had been deceiving him from the start. Not altogether deceiving
  him, however, for Phil’s suspicions had already been so far aroused that
  it could not be said that he had been hoodwinked completely. But for these
  suspicions, indeed, he would not now so readily have observed the man’s
  speech and behavior. He would not so accurately have interpreted his truculence
  when he commanded him to “go to a sweep,” and the man answered, “Not if
  I know it!” and went to the cabin instead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>But at that moment Phil had no time to deal further with the fellow, or
  even to think of him. For just as dark was falling, the flatboat swung
  around a sharp bend in the chute, and came suddenly face to face with a
  great, roaring, glaring, glittering steamboat that was running the chute
  up stream at racing speed.</p>
<p>The steamboat whistled madly, and reversed her engines full force. The
  captain, the pilot, both the mates, all the deck-hands, all the roustabouts,
  and most of the male passengers on board shouted in chorus, with much of
  objurgation for punctuation marks, to know what the flatboat meant by running
  the chute down stream.</p>
<p>Phil paid no attention to the hullabaloo, but gave his whole mind to the
  problem of navigating his own craft. The steamboat’s wheels, as she backed
  water so mightily, threw forward great waves which, catching the flatboat
  under the bow, drove her stern-on toward the bank. By a vigorous use of
  the sweeps, and a great deal of tugging on his own part at the steering-oar,
  Phil managed to slew the boat around in time to prevent her going ashore;
  and fortunately there was just passageway enough to let her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> slip
  by the steamer, grazing the guards in passing.</p>
<p>It was the work of a very few minutes, but it seemed an age to the anxious
  boy; and as the steamer resumed her course, her crew sending back a volley
  of maledictions, his only thought was one of congratulation that he had
  escaped from so desperate an entanglement.</p>
<p>Just then, however, he observed Jim Hughes at the stern, climbing into
  the towed skiff, into which he had already thrown his carpet-bag. He observed
  also that before engaging in this manœuvre the pilot had set up a handkerchief
  at the bow, apparently as a signal, and that some rough-looking men were
  gathered on the shore just astern.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash Phil realized that for some reason Jim Hughes was quitting
  the boat, and was in communication with the men on shore.</p>
<p>Without quite realizing why he should object to this, he proceeded to
  put a stop to it. He called to his comrades, who could now leave the oars,
  as the boat was floating out of the chute and into the main river again,
  to come to his assistance. Without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> parley
  they tumbled over the end of the boat into the skiff, which had not yet
  been cast loose, and there seized the runaway. He fought with a good deal
  of desperation, but five stalwart Hoosier boys are apt to be more than
  a match for any one man, however strong and however desperate he may be.
  They quickly overcame Jim Hughes and hustled him back on board the flatboat.
  There they held him down, while one of them, at Phil’s request, ran for
  some rope. A minute later they had their prisoner securely tied, both as
  to arms and as to legs, and dropped him, feet first, down the cabin stairs.</p>
<p>No sooner was he out of the way than the men on shore began firing at
  the flatboat. They had refrained prior to that time, apparently, lest they
  should hit their comrade, for such he manifestly was. Their firing was
  at long range, however, and it was now nearly dark. The swift current soon
  carried the boat wholly beyond reach of rifle-shots and out into the river.
  Lest the desperadoes on shore should follow in skiffs or otherwise, Phil
  ordered the boys to the sweeps again, and kept them there until they had
  driven the boat well over toward the opposite shore. Then he summoned a
  council of war.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/fight.jpg" width="336" height="600" alt="" /><br />THE FIGHT WITH THE PILOT.<br />
“A minute later they had their prisoner securely tied.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>“What are we going to do with that fellow?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ed, “you have got him well tied and—”</p>
<p>“Yes, but,” said Irv, “have we any right to tie him? He hasn’t committed
  any crime.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he has,” said Phil. “At least, we caught him in the act of committing
  one. He was trying to steal one of Perry Raymond’s skiffs. That’s worth
  twenty-five dollars. If he hadn’t anything worse in his mind, his attempt
  on the skiff was grand larceny.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Ed, “and we can turn him over to a magistrate at the
  first landing for that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I shall make any landing,” said Phil, “until we get to
  Memphis, and in the meantime I am going to know all there is to know about
  this fellow. When he came on board he had his hair shaved close with a
  barber’s mowing-machine, but, unfortunately for him, he didn’t bring one
  of the machines with him. His hair is growing out again now, and I have
  been comparing several of its little peculiarities closely with descriptions
  and portraits in the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> I
  got at Cairo of the fellow who is running away with that swag. Boys, I
  believe we have got the man.”</p>
<p>Phil’s comrades were positively dumb with astonishment. At last the silence
  was broken.</p>
<p>“If we have,” said Irv Strong, “this voyage will pay, for the rewards
  offered for this man are very heavy.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Phil; “I hadn’t thought of that, but that’s so. There are
  five thousand dollars on his capture.”</p>
<p>Just then there was a flash in the dark from the cabin scuttle, and a
  bullet whistled over the heads of the boys. Jim Hughes had managed to extricate
  himself, in part at least, from his bonds, and had begun to use a weapon
  which he had doubtless hidden before that time, and of which the boys had
  known nothing.</p>
<p>Ed was the first to act. He was always exceedingly quick to think. He
  called to the boys to follow him, and, disregarding Jim’s fusillade, ran
  to the scuttle.</p>
<p>In an instant, by their united efforts, they pushed the fellow back and
  closed the lid that covered the stairs. Then Ed remembered that there was
  a door leading out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> the
  cabin into the hold of the boat. He suggested to two of the boys that they
  go below, and close that with bales of hay and the like. They did so hurriedly,
  piling the hay and some apple barrels against the door, until it would
  have required the strength of half a dozen men to push it open. In the
  meantime Ed had possessed himself of a hatchet and nails, and had securely
  nailed down the scuttle.</p>
<p>Just then Irv Strong thought of something.</p>
<p>“Suppose he gets desperate? He could easily set fire to things down there.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Phil, who had just returned from the hold. “Bring the
  fire-extinguishers.”</p>
<p>By the time they got the four large carbonic acid receptacles a new thought
  had occurred to Ed.</p>
<p>“Bring an auger, boys. There’s one lying forward there. The big one.”</p>
<p>It was quickly brought, though none of the boys could guess what Ed intended
  to do. He took the auger, and quickly bored an inch hole in the scuttle.
  A flash and a bullet came through it, but nobody was hurt.</p>
<p>“Now, give me an extinguisher,” said Ed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>Putting the nozzle of the hose through the hole, he turned the apparatus
  upside down, and allowed its contents to be driven violently into the little
  cabin. When the first extinguisher was exhausted he turned on the hose
  of another, and after that of a third.</p>
<p>For a while the imprisoned man, shut up in a box ten feet by twelve and
  not over five or six feet high, indulged in lusty yells, but these soon
  became husky, and presently ceased entirely. The moment they did, Ed called
  out:—</p>
<p>“Rip off the scuttle quick, boys; he’s suffocated.”</p>
<p>The boys did not at all understand what had happened, but they acted promptly
  in obedience to their wisest comrade’s order. When the scuttle was opened
  and a lantern brought, Jim was seen lying limp at the foot of the little
  ladder.</p>
<p>“Now, be careful,” said Ed. “Irving, you and Phil—you’re the strongest—go
  down, hold your breath, and drag him up. Be sure to hold your breath. Do
  just as you do when you’re diving.”</p>
<p>They made an effort, but almost instantly came back, gasping for air,
  sneezing, and with eyes and noses tingling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>“Catch your breath quick,” said Ed, “and go down again. You must get him
  out, or he will be dead, if he isn’t dead already.”</p>
<p>They made another dash, this time acting more carefully upon the instruction
  to treat the descent as if it were a dive, and carefully holding their
  breath. In a brief while they dragged the body of the pilot out upon the
  deck, and Ed gave directions for restoring life by artificial respiration.</p>
<p>“You see, he’s practically a drowned man,” he said.</p>
<p>“Drowned?” said Will Moreraud. “Why, he’s not even been in the water,
  and that little dash with the hose wouldn’t drown a kitten.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” said Ed; “quick now; he’s drowned, or just the same
  thing. We must bring him to life.”</p>
<p>“Well, slip that rope around his arms and legs while we do it,” said Phil,
  “or we’ll have trouble when he comes to.”</p>
<p>This was a suggestion which they all recognized as altogether timely,
  and so the apparent corpse was carefully secured by two of the boys, while
  the rest worked at the task of restoring him to life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>He “came to” in a little while, and lay stretched out upon the deck, weak
  and exhausted. Then, at Ed’s suggestion, the boys went below by the forward
  door, rolled away the obstructions, and threw open the door of the cabin,
  so that all the air possible might pass through it. It was half an hour
  at least before breathing became comfortable in that little box. Then Phil
  made a thorough exploration of Jim’s carpet-bag, bunk, and everything else
  that pertained to him. His only remark as to the result of his personal
  inquiry was:—</p>
<p>“I guess we needn’t trouble ourselves about having arrested this man.”</p>
<p>While waiting for the air to render the cabin habitable again, Constant
  said, “But, Ed, how did he <i>drown</i> without going into the water? I
  don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Neither do I,” said Will Moreraud; “but he was drowned all safe enough.
  I’ve seen too many drowned people not to know one when I see him.”</p>
<p>Then Ed explained:—</p>
<p>“That cabin is a little box about ten feet by twelve, and six feet high,
  and when shut up it’s nearly air tight. It contains only a little over
  seven hundred cubic feet of air. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> chemical
  fire extinguishers are filled with water saturated with soda or saleratus.
  There is a bottle in each one, filled with oil of vitriol, or a coarse,
  cheap sort of sulphuric acid. It is so arranged that when you turn the
  thing upside down the bottle breaks, and the acid is dumped into the water.
  Now when you pour sulphuric acid into a mixture of water and soda, the
  soda gives off an enormous quantity of what is commonly called carbonic
  acid gas, though I believe its right name is carbon dioxide. At any rate,
  it is the same gas that makes soda water ‘fizz.’ But when you turn one
  of these machines upside down you get about ten or twenty times as much
  of the gas in the water as there is in the same quantity of soda water;
  and when you turn this doubled and twisted soda water loose it gives off
  its gas in enormous quantities. Now this gas is heavier than air, so when
  it was set loose down in the cabin there, it sank to the bottom, and the
  air floated on top of it. As the cabin filled up with the gas the air came
  out through the hole in the scuttle and the cracks round it. Pouring that
  gas into the cabin was just like pouring water into a jug; the gas took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> the
  place of air just as the water in the jug takes the place of the air that
  was in it at first.</p>
<p>“Suppose you let a lighted lantern down into the cabin, Will,” suggested
  the older boy, “and see what happens.”</p>
<p>Will did so, and the lantern went out as promptly as it would have done
  if plunged into water.</p>
<p>“You see,” said Ed, “this gas puts out fire, and it puts out life in the
  same way. It smothers both. It absolutely excludes oxygen, and neither
  animal life nor fire can exist without oxygen. Do I make the thing clear?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly,” said all the boys.</p>
<p>“Then that’s why we choked so when we went down the ladder?” said Phil.</p>
<p>“Certainly. Your air was as completely cut off as if you had dived into
  water. That’s why I cautioned you to hold your breath just as if you had
  been diving into the river.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">“TALKING BUSINESS”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Naturally</span> the boys were too much excited over
  their capture to talk of anything else, and for a time they did not even
  think or talk of the most important phase of that. They discussed the shooting,
  which all of them saw to be reason enough for the arrest, but it was not
  until well on into the night that any of them thought to ask Phil about
  the results of his search of Jim’s satchel.</p>
<p>Meantime they had carried the pinioned man below and securely bound him
  to his bunk. Then they had cooked and eaten their supper, talking all the
  time, each playfully describing his own consternation at every step of
  the late proceeding. Finally Will Moreraud said:—</p>
<p>“By the way, what does it all mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” joined in Irv Strong, “it at last begins to dawn upon my hitherto
  excited consciousness, that we have not yet heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> the
  results of Phil’s explorations among Jim’s effects. Tell us all about it,
  Phil.”</p>
<p>They were sitting in the cabin, or half way in it. That is to say, Phil
  was sitting in the mouth of the scuttle above, watching the river and the
  course of the flatboat; Irv sat just below him on the steps, and the other
  boys were gathered around the little table at the foot of the ladder.</p>
<p>“One of you come up here, then,” said Phil, “and keep the lookout while
  I tell you about it. I thought you’d ask after you got through relating
  your personal experiences.”</p>
<p>Ed volunteered to take the place at the top of the stairs, although his
  frail nerves were now quivering after the strain he had been through. Phil
  seized the carpet-bag which he had instinctively kept under his hand all
  the time, and descended the ladder.</p>
<p>There he opened it and spread its contents on the table.</p>
<p>“These are what I have found,” he said, suppressing his excitement. “This
  big bundle of government bonds,” laying it on the table; “this big bundle
  of railroad and other securities,” laying that down in its turn; “this
  great wad of greenbacks, and, best of all, <i>these</i>!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>As he finished, he held up a bundle of letters.</p>
<p>“What are they? Why are they the best part of all?” queried the boys in
  a breath.</p>
<p>“They are letters from Jim Hughes’s fellow criminals. I called them ‘best
  of all’ because they will enable the authorities to catch and convict the
  whole gang!”</p>
<p>The exultation of the crew was great.</p>
<p>“We shall have rendered a great service to the public, shan’t we?” asked
  Constant.</p>
<p>“A very great service, indeed. And that’s what we must rejoice in,” answered
  Ed. “But we mustn’t fail to render it. We mustn’t let the thief slip his
  bonds and escape.”</p>
<p>Hughes was lying there in his bunk all the while, but they paid no attention
  to him. They had ceased to think of him as a man. To them he was only a
  criminal, just as he might have been an alligator or a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>“Oh, we’ll take good care of that,” responded Phil. “From this moment
  till we deliver him to the officers of the law, we’ll keep one fellow always
  right here on guard over him. It will mean double duty for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> some
  of you to-night, for I’m going ashore presently.”</p>
<p>“Going ashore! What for, and where?” was eagerly asked.</p>
<p>“There’s a little town down here somewhere, as I see by the map, and when
  we get to it I’m going ashore to send telegrams. You see, Hughes’s ‘pals’
  might have somebody at Memphis armed with a <i>habeas corpus</i> or something
  of that sort, and take him away from us. I’ve a mind to deliver the fugitive
  myself. So I propose to have officers to meet us with warrants and things
  when we reach Memphis.”</p>
<p>“Good idea,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“And there’s the town just a little way ahead,” called out Ed, from the
  top of the ladder.</p>
<p>Phil went at once on deck, leaped into the skiff and rowed rapidly ahead
  of the slowly floating flatboat, or as rapidly as the drift would let him.
  When he reached the village he found to his disappointment that there was
  no telegraph office there. But he learned that there was one at the hydrographic
  engineer’s station a few miles below, on the opposite side of the river.</p>
<p>By this time the flatboat had passed him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> and
  he had a long “stern chase” through the darkness and drift before he could
  overtake and board her again.</p>
<p>Then, assigning Ed to guard their prisoner in the cabin, he called the
  other boys to the sweeps.</p>
<p>“The river is very wide here,” he explained, “and the telegraph station
  is on the other side. We must take the boat well over there.”</p>
<p>The boys pulled with a will, and long before the station came in view
  the flatboat was close in shore on the farther side of the river.</p>
<p>Meantime, or a little later, something happened in the cabin. Ed was reading
  a book, when suddenly the prisoner called out:—</p>
<p>“Ed.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” said the boy, laying down his book.</p>
<p>“I’m awfully tired, lying in one position. Can’t you turn me over a bit?”</p>
<p>Ed went at once to his relief. His torture was no part of the purpose
  of anybody on board. But after Ed had readjusted the ropes so that the
  fellow could rest more comfortably, the prisoner said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>“See here, Ed, I want to talk to you. You fellows have made a tremendous
  strike, for of course there’s no use in disguising the truth any longer,
  to you at least, or pretending to be what I have tried to appear. You’ve
  got your man and you’ve got the proofs dead to rights. You’ve found me
  with the swag in my possession. If you turn me over to the law, I’ll go
  up for ten or twenty years to a certainty. There is no use in defending
  myself. The case is too clear, too complete. Do you see?”</p>
<p>“Certainly” responded Ed. “You must pay the penalty of your crime. We
  have no personal hard feeling against you, Jim, except that you ought not
  to have tried to involve us boys as you have done, and—”</p>
<p>“Well, you see, Ed,” interrupted the bound man, “I was desperate. There
  was a big price on my head, and hundreds of men were looking for me everywhere.
  On the one hand, a prison stared me in the face, on the other was freedom
  with abundant wealth to enjoy it with. If I could get down the river, I
  thought I should have everything snug and right. I didn’t mean to get you
  boys into any trouble—really and truly I didn’t, Ed. My plan was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> blunder
  into that chute, and while you fellows were all scared half to death about
  it, to slip ashore. I had those men on the bank just for safety’s sake.
  They don’t really know anything about me or what I’ve got—what I did have,”
  he corrected, with sudden recollection that his carpet-bag was no longer
  in his possession.</p>
<p>“Those men were hired by my partners to have horses there and run me off
  into Mississippi, and I was to give them a hundred or two for the job,
  besides paying for the horses we might ride to death. Really and truly,
  Ed, that’s all there was of that.”</p>
<p>“I see no particular reason to doubt your statement, Jim,” replied the
  boy. “But what of it?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see, I want to talk business with you, Ed, and I wanted you
  to know, in the first place, that I hadn’t tried to harm you boys in any
  way—at least, till I was caught in a trap by that sharp brother of yours.”
  There was a distinct touch of malignity in the man’s tone as he mentioned
  Phil, to whom he justly attributed his capture.</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” he resumed after a moment. “I want to talk business
  with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> you,
  as I said. Here are you five boys, all alone on the river. Anything might
  happen to a flatboat. You’re likely to make, as nearly as I can figure
  it out from your talk, about fifty or a hundred or at most a hundred and
  fifty dollars apiece out of the trip, after paying steamboat passage back.
  Now you’ve caught me. If you surrender me—”</p>
<p>“Which of course we shall,” broke in Ed, in astonishment.</p>
<p>“As I was saying” continued Jim, “if you surrender me, you’ll probably
  get the reward offered, though that’s never quite certain.”</p>
<p>“What possible difference can that make?” asked Ed, indignantly. “You’re
  a thief. We have caught you with hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth
  of other people’s property in your possession. We have only one thing to
  do. We must deliver you to the officers of the law. We should do that if
  not a cent of reward was offered. We should do it simply because we’re
  ordinarily honest persons who think that thieves ought to be punished and
  that stolen property ought to be returned to its owners. What has the reward
  to do with it?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’m glad you look at it in that way,” said the prisoner. “At most the
  reward is a trifle, as you say. Five thousand dollars to five of you means
  only a thousand dollars apiece. Now I’ve a business proposition to make.
  Suppose you let me slip ashore somewhere down here, I’ll leave behind me—I’ll
  put into your hands all the coupon bonds. They’re better than cash—they
  are good for their face and a good deal more anywhere. You boys can sink
  the old flatboat down the river somewhere, sell out the bonds to any banker,
  and go ashore rich—worth more than anybody in Vevay’s got, or ever will
  have.”</p>
<p>The man spoke eagerly, but not excitedly, and he watched closely to see
  the effect of his words.</p>
<p>Ed preserved his self-control. Indeed, it was his habit always to grow
  cool, or at least to seem so, in precise proportion to the occasion for
  growing hot. He waited awhile before he spoke. Then he said:—</p>
<p>“Jim Hughes,—or whatever your name is—well, I’ll simply call you Thief,
  for that name belongs to you even if nothing else that you possess does,—you
  thief, if you had made such a proposition as that to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> father,
  he would have—well, he was said to be hot-headed. I’m not hot-headed—”</p>
<p>“No. You’re reasonable. You’re—”</p>
<p>“Stop!” shouted Ed. “If you weren’t tied up there and helpless, you’d
  make me hot-headed, too, like my father, and I’d do to you what he would
  have done. As it is, I’m cool-headed. I’ll ‘talk business’ with you; and
  the business I have to talk is just this: I forbid you from this moment
  to open your mouth again, except to ask for water, while you are on this
  flatboat. If you say one other word to me or to any of my companions I’ll
  forget that I am not my hot-headed father, and—well, it will be very greatly
  the worst for you. Now not a word!” seeing that the fellow was about to
  speak. “Not a word, except the word ‘water,’ till my brother turns you
  over to the officers of the law. I’m not captain, but this particular order
  of mine ‘goes.’ I’m going to ask my brother to pass it on to the others,
  and it will be enforced, be very sure. They are not cool-headed as I am,
  particularly Phil. He’s like my father sometimes. Remember, you are not
  to speak any word except ‘water’ till you pass from our custody.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>The high-strung boy tried to control himself, but he was livid with rage.
  He choked and gasped for breath as he spoke. Weak as he was physically,
  he would certainly have assaulted the man who had deliberately proposed
  to make him a partner in crime, but for the fact that the fellow was bound,
  hand and foot, and therefore helpless. In his rage Ed ran up the ladder
  and called for his brother, meaning to ask that the man be released from
  his bonds in order that he, Ed Lowry, might wreck vengeance upon him for
  the insult.</p>
<p>Phil had gone ashore to send his telegrams. Irv Strong had been left in
  command of the boat. He asked Ed what was the matter. Ed, still choking
  with rage, explained as well as he could, growing more excited every moment,
  and ended by demanding:—</p>
<p>“Let the scoundrel loose! cut the ropes that bind him, and give me a chance
  at him!”</p>
<p>“Hold on, Ed,” said Irv. “The wise Benjamin Franklin once said: ‘No gentleman <i>will</i> insult
  one; no other <i>can</i>.’ This thief, burglar, bank robber, that we’ve
  got tied in a bunk down there, <i>can’t</i> insult <i>you</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> He
  doesn’t know our kind. He isn’t in our class. It never occurs to his mind
  that anybody is really honest. It seems to him a question of price, and
  he thinks he has offered you mighty good terms. If any man who understood
  common honesty and believed in its existence had made such a proposition
  to you, your wrath would be righteous. As it is, your wrath is merely ridiculous.
  Of course a trapped bank burglar tries to buy his way out with his swag.
  Of course such a creature doesn’t know what honest people think or feel—he
  has no capacity to understand it any more than he could understand Russian.
  Go below, Constant, and watch that thief. Ed, you must recover yourself.
  Phil will come aboard presently, and I really don’t suppose you want to
  tell Phil precisely what has happened and leave <i>him</i> to—well, let
  us say to <i>discipline</i> Jim Hughes.”</p>
<p>“No, no; oh, no!” said Ed, suddenly realizing what that would mean. “Phil
  would—oh, I don’t know what he wouldn’t do. For conscience’ sake don’t
  tell him what happened!”</p>
<p>“Suppose you go forward then,” suggested Irv, “and sit down on the anchor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> and
  cool off, and so far recover yourself that Phil won’t notice anything or
  ask any questions when he comes aboard.”</p>
<p>The suggestion was very quietly given, quite as if the whole matter had
  been one of no consequence. But it was instantly effective. Irv well knew
  that Ed’s greatest dread was that Phil’s fiery temper might get the better
  of him sometime. So Irv had shrewdly appealed to that fear.</p>
<p>“I will; I’ll cool down at once,” said Ed, rising in his earnestness.
  “Nobody knows what Phil would do or wouldn’t do if he knew of this. Irv,
  you must prevent that. Make all the boys pledge themselves not to let him
  know, at least till Hughes is out of our hands.”</p>
<p>Irv was glad enough to make the promise and to fulfil it. For he, too,
  knew with what reckless fervor the high-mettled boy would be sure to inflict
  punishment for the insult should he learn of it.</p>
<p>“Phil is the jolliest, best-natured fellow in the world,” explained Irv,
  when he asked the other boys not to tell their captain what had happened,
  “but you know what a temper he has—or rather you don’t know. None of us
  does, because nobody has ever made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> the
  mistake of stirring him up with a real, vital insult.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Will, “and I pity the fellow that ever makes that particular
  mistake.”</p>
<p>“We’ll never tell him,” said Constant. “If we did, we mightn’t be able
  to deliver our prisoner.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">AT ANCHOR</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> had sent two telegrams,—one to the authorities
  at Memphis, and the other to the plundered bank in Cincinnati. In each
  he had announced his captures,—the man and the funds,—and in each he had
  asked that officers to arrest and persons to identify the culprit should
  be waiting at Memphis on the arrival of the flatboat.</p>
<p>On his return to the flatboat he felt himself so excited and sleepless
  that he sent his comrades below to sleep and by turns to watch the prisoner.
  He would himself remain on duty on deck all night. As the night wore away,
  the boy thought out all the possibilities, for he felt that for any miscarriage
  in this matter he would be solely responsible.</p>
<p>Among the possibilities was this: that should the flatboat arrive at Memphis
  before some one could get there from Cincinnati to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> identify
  the prisoner, he might be discharged for want of such identification. It
  would take a day or two to send men by rail from Cincinnati to Memphis,
  while the fierce current of this Mississippi flood promised to take the
  flatboat thither within less than twenty hours.</p>
<p>After working out all the probabilities in his mind as well as he could,
  Phil called below for all his comrades to come to the sweeps. He did not
  tell them his purpose; they were too sleepy even to ask. But studying the
  “lay of the land” on either side, he steered the flatboat into a sort of
  pocket on the Tennessee shore, and to the bewilderment of his comrades,
  ordered the anchor cast overboard.</p>
<p>By the time that the anchor held, and the boat came to a rest in the bend,
  the boys were much too wide awake not to have their minds full of interrogation
  marks.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Phil?” “Why have we anchored?” “How long are we to
  remain here?” “What’s the matter, anyhow?” “Have you gone crazy, or what
  is it?”</p>
<p>These and a volley of similar questions were fired at him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>He did not answer. He went to one side of the boat and then to the other
  to observe position.</p>
<p>“How much anchor line is out, Will?” he presently asked.</p>
<p>“Nearly all of it,” answered his comrade.</p>
<p>“This won’t do,” said Phil. “Up anchor.”</p>
<p>The boys were more than ever puzzled. But they tugged away at the anchor
  windlass till the flukes let go the bottom and the anchor was halfway up.
  Then Phil called out:—</p>
<p>“That will do. Put a peg in the windlass and let the anchor swing in the
  water. To the sweeps! Hard on the starboard! We must push her inshore and
  into shallower water, where the anchor will hold her, and where no steamboat
  is likely to run over us. Who would have thought it was so deep over here?”</p>
<p>The boys now began to understand why the first anchorage had been abandoned
  and a shallower one sought for, but they did not yet know what their captain
  meant by anchoring at all. They did not understand why, on so clear a night,
  with a river so generously flooded, he did not let things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> take
  their course and get to Memphis as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Presently the anchor, dragging at half cable, fouled the bottom and, with
  a strain that made the check-post creak, the flatboat came to a full stop.</p>
<p>“That will do,” said Phil. “This is as good a place as any. Pay out some
  more anchor line and let her rest.”</p>
<p>“But what on earth are you anchoring for?” asked the others, “and how
  long are we going to lie here?” queried Ed.</p>
<p>“Nearly two days and nights,” was the reply,—“long enough to let somebody
  travel from Cincinnati to Memphis who can identify Jim Hughes and take
  him off our hands. I suppose it would be all right if we went on without
  waiting. But I’m not certain of that, and I’m not taking any chances in
  this business, so we’ll lie at anchor here for nearly two days. Go to bed,
  all of you except the one on watch over Jim Hughes. I’m not sleepy, so
  I’ll stay on deck for the rest of the night.”</p>
<p>But by that time the boys were not sleepy either, so they made no haste
  about going to their bunks.</p>
<p>“We’ll be pretty short of something to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> eat
  by that time,” said Constant, who was just then in charge of the cooking.
  “We have only a scrap of bread left. The eggs and fresh meat and milk are
  used up, and we’ll have to fall back on corn-bread and fried salt pork.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s food fit for the gods,” said Irv Strong, “if the gods happen
  to be healthy, hungry flatboatmen. But how important the food question
  always is in an emergency! How it always crops up when you get away from
  home!”</p>
<p>“Yes, and at home too,” said Ed; “only there we have somebody else to
  look after the three meals a day. It’s the most important question in the
  world. If all food supplies were cut off for a single month, this world
  would be as dead as the moon.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” broke in Will. “And really, I suppose the world isn’t very
  forehanded with it at best. I wonder how many years we could last, anyhow,
  if the crops ceased to grow.”</p>
<p>“Not more than one year,” replied the older boy. “There never was a time
  when mankind had food enough accumulated to last for much more than a year,
  and probably there never will be. If there should be no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> crop
  for a single year, hundreds of thousands would starve every month, and
  a second failure would simply blot out the race. As for forehandedness,
  we actually live from hand to mouth, especially the people in the big cities.
  Only last winter a great snowstorm blockaded the railroads leading into
  New York for only three or four days, and even in that short time the price
  of food went up so high that the charitable institutions had all they could
  do to keep poor people from starving. So far from the world generally being
  forehanded for food, there never was a time when the food on hand was really
  sufficient to go round.”</p>
<p>“Well, of course,” said Will, meditatively, “there are always some people
  so ‘down on their luck,’ as the saying is, that they can’t earn a living,
  but there’s always enough food for them if they could get hold of it.”</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken,” said Ed. “There is nearly always something like a famine
  in parts of India and Russia, and even in Italy and other parts of Europe
  there are great masses of very hard-working people who never in their lives
  get enough to eat.”</p>
<p>There were exclamations of surprise at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> this,
  but Ed presently continued: “In many European countries the peasants do
  not see a piece of meat once a year, and in hardly any of them do the poorer
  people get what we would think sufficient for food. In fact, their food
  is not sufficient. They are always more or less starved, and that’s the
  reason so many of them are the little runts they are.”</p>
<p>“Then we are better off than most other nations?” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Immeasurably!” said Ed. “Ours is the best fed nation in the world. It
  is the only nation in which the poorest laborer can have meat on his table
  every day in the year, for even in England the poorer laborers have to
  make out with cheese pretty often.”</p>
<p>“What’s the reason?” asked Phil, who had acquired the habit of using short
  sentences and as few words as possible since his burden of responsibility
  had borne so heavily upon him.</p>
<p>“There are several reasons. Our soil is fertile—but so is that of France
  and Italy, for that matter. I suppose the great reason is that we do not
  have to support vast armies in idleness. In most of the European countries
  they make everybody serve in the army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> for
  three or four years. It costs a lot of money to support these armies and
  it costs the country a great deal more than that.”</p>
<p>“In what way?” asked Constant, who, being on sentry duty over Hughes,
  was sitting halfway down the ladder.</p>
<p>“Why, by taking all the young men away from productive work for three
  years. Take half a million young men away from work and put them in the
  army, and you lose each year all the work that a man could do in half a
  million years, all the food or other things that half a million men could
  produce in a year?”</p>
<p>“And the other people have to make it all up,” drawled Irv. “I don’t wonder
  they’re tired.”</p>
<p>“And besides making it all up, as you say,” responded Ed, “those other
  people have to work to feed and clothe and house and arm all these men,
  besides transporting them from one place to another, and paying for costly
  parades and all that sort of thing. Why, every time one of the big modern
  guns is fired at a target it burns up some man’s earnings for a whole year!
  Some man must work a year or more to pay the expense of doing it!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>“Then why don’t the people of those countries ‘kick’?” asked Will, “and
  abolish their armies?”</p>
<p>“Because the people of those countries have masters, and the masters own
  the armies, and the armies would make short work of any ‘kick.’ In our
  country the people are the masters, and they have always refused to let
  anybody set up a great standing army. When we have a war, the people volunteer
  and fight it to a finish. Then the men who have been doing the fighting
  are mustered out, and they go back to their work, earn their own living,
  and put in their time producing something that mankind needs.”</p>
<p>“Cipher it all down,” said Irv, “it’s liberty that makes this the best
  country in the world to live in.”</p>
<p>“Precisely!” said Ed, with emphasis. “And about the most important duty
  every American has to do is to remember that one, supreme fact, and do
  his part to keep our country as it is.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">AT BREAKFAST</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day was dawning by this time, and the conversation
  was broken up. Constant set to work to prepare breakfast while the others
  extinguished the lanterns, trimmed them, filled them with oil, and “cleaned
  up” generally.</p>
<p>When breakfast was served, the scarcity of supplies was apparent. There
  were some “cold-water hoecakes,”—that is to say, bread made of corn-meal
  mixed up with cold water and a little salt, and baked in cakes about half
  or three quarters of an inch thick upon a griddle. There was a dish of
  fried salt pork, and with it some fried potatoes. And there was nothing
  else, except a “private dish” consisting of two slices of toast made from
  the scrap of stale wheat bread left, with a poached egg on each of them.
  There was no coffee and no butter, the last remains of that having been
  used upon the toast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>The “private dish,” Constant explained, was for Ed. “You see, we’re out
  to get him well, and his digestive apparatus doesn’t take kindly to fried
  things. I’ve saved four more eggs for him—the last we’ve got,—and six more
  slices of stale wheat bread. The rest of you are barbarians, and you’ll
  wrestle with any sort of hash I can get up till we get to Memphis.”</p>
<p>Ed protested vigorously against the favoritism shown him, but the others
  supported Constant’s plan, and the older boy had to yield.</p>
<p>“Well, I am deeply grateful for your kindness, boys,” he said, “and I’m
  duly grateful also to the thousands of men in various parts of the country
  who have worked so hard to furnish me with these two slices of toast.”</p>
<p>The boys looked up from their plates.</p>
<p>“Here’s another revelation,” said Irv. “My ill-furnished intelligence
  is about to receive another supply of much-needed rudimentary information.
  Go on, Ed. Tell us about it. How in the world do you figure out your ‘thousands’
  of men who have had anything to do with those two slices of toast?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, that was a joke,” said Will.</p>
<p>“It was nothing of the kind,” answered Ed. “I can’t possibly count up
  all the people who have worked hard to give me this toast, but they certainly
  number greatly more than a thousand.”</p>
<p>“We’re only waiting for wisdom to drop from your lips—” began Irv, with
  his drawl.</p>
<p>“O, quit it, Irv!” said Phil; “you’ll learn more by listening than by
  talking.”</p>
<p>“That is probably so,” said the other, “though I remember that we heard
  something away up the river, about how much a person learns of a subject
  by talking about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Ed, “and I’ll explain. The wheat out of which this toast
  was made was grown probably in Dakota or Minnesota. There was a farmer
  there, and perhaps there were some farm-hands also, who ploughed the ground,
  sowed the seed, reaped the wheat, threshed it, winnowed it, and all that.
  Then—”</p>
<p>“Yes, but all that wouldn’t include more than half a dozen,” said Phil.</p>
<p>“Yes, it would,” said Irv, “for ther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>e’s
  all the womenfolk who cooked the men’s meals and—”</p>
<p>“Never mind them,” said Ed, “though of course they helped to give me my
  toast. Let’s count only those that contributed directly to that kindly
  end. These farmer people used ploughs, harrows, drills, reapers, threshing-machines,
  wagons, and all that, and somebody must have made them. And back of those
  who made them were those who dug the iron for them out of the ground, and
  cut the wood in them out of the forest, and the men who made the tools
  with which they did all this, and—”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Irv. “It’s the biggest endless chain imaginable. Thousands?
  Why, thousands had a hand in it before you even get to the farmer—the men
  who made the tools, and the men who made the tools that made the tools,
  and so on back to the very beginnings of creation. And if we face about,
  there are the men that ran the railroads which hauled the wheat to mill,
  and the millers, and all that. Oh, the thousand are easy enough to make
  out.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed, “and then the railroads and the mills had to be built.
  The men that built them, the engineers, mechanics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> and
  laborers, all helped to give me my two slices of toast. So did the men
  behind them, the men who made their tools and their materials, the woodsmen
  who chopped trees for ties, the miners who dug the iron, the smelters,
  the puddlers, the rolling-mill men, who wrought the crude ore into steel
  rails; then there are all the men who made the locomotives, and the cars,
  and the machinery of the mills, and—”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop for mercy’s sake,” said Will. “It’s no use to count. There aren’t
  thousands, but millions of them. And of course the same thing is true of
  our clothes, our shoes, and everything else.”</p>
<p>“But with so many people’s work represented in it,” asked Irv, reflectively,
  “why isn’t that piece of toast an enormously costly affair?”</p>
<p>“Simply <i>because</i> so many people’s work is represented in it,” answered
  Ed. “If one man had to do it all for himself, it would never be done at
  all. Just imagine a man set down on the earth with no tools and nobody
  to help him. How much buttered toast do you suppose he would be able to
  turn out in a year? Why, before he could get so much as a hoe he would
  have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> travel
  hundreds of miles, dig some iron and coal, cut wood with which to convert
  the coal into coke, melt the iron out of its ore, change it into steel,
  and shape it into a hoe. Why, even a hoe would cost him a year’s hard work
  or more, while a wagon he could hardly make without tools in a lifetime.
  Now he can earn the price of a hoe in a few hours, and the cost of a wagon
  in a few days or weeks, simply because everybody works for everybody else,
  each man doing only the thing that he can do best.”</p>
<p>“Then we all work for each other without knowing it,” said Will.</p>
<p>“Of course we do. When we fellows were diving for that pig-iron, we were
  working for the thousands of people who will use or profit by the things
  that somebody else will make out of that pig-iron and—”</p>
<p>“And for the somebody else,” said Irv, “that will make those things out
  of the pig-iron, and for all the ‘somebody elses’ that work for them, and
  so on in every direction! Whew! it makes my head swim to think of it. But
  what a nabob you are, Ed! Just think! Thousands and even millions of people
  are, at this moment, at work to make you comfortable!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, and each one of the millions is at work for all the others while
  all the others are at work for him. Theorists sometimes dream out systems
  of ‘coöperative industry,’ hoping in that way to better men’s condition.
  But their very wildest dreams do not even approach the complex and perfectly
  working coöperation we already have in use.”</p>
<p>“Just think of it!” said Irv. “Suppose that every man in our little town
  of two or three thousand people had to do everything for himself! He would
  have to raise sheep for wool, card, spin, and weave it, and fashion it
  into clothes. He would have to raise cotton and linen in the same way,
  and cattle too, and keep a tannery and be a shoemaker and a farmer and
  a mason and a carpenter and all the rest of it. And then he would have
  to mine his own iron and coal, and make his own tools and—well, he wouldn’t
  do it, because he couldn’t. He’d just wander off into the woods hunting
  for something that he could kill and eat, and he’d try to kill anybody
  else that did the same thing, for fear that the somebody else would get
  some of the game that he wanted for himself. He’d be simply a savage!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, but even savages go in tribes and hunt together and live together,”
  said Will.</p>
<p>“Of course they do,” answered Ed, “and that’s their first step up toward
  civilization. When they do that they have learned in a small way the advantage
  of working together, each for all and all for each. The better they learn
  that lesson, the more civilized they become.”</p>
<p>“Then the theorists are right who want the state to own everything and
  everybody to work for the state and be supported by it?” asked Phil.</p>
<p>“Not a little bit of it,” said Ed. “That would be simply to go back to
  the tribal plan that savages adopt when they first realize the advantages
  of working together, and abandon when they grow civilized. We have worked
  out of that and into something better. With us, every man works for all
  the rest by working for himself in the way that best serves his own welfare.
  Under our system every man is urged and stimulated by self-interest to
  do the very best and most work that he can. Under a communistic or socialistic
  or tribal system, every man would be as lazy as the rest would let him
  be, because he would be sure of a share in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> all
  that the others might make by their labor. It is sharp competition that
  makes men do their best. It is in the ‘struggle for existence’ that men
  advance most rapidly.”</p>
<p>“Wonder if that wasn’t what Humboldt meant,” said Irv, “when he called
  the banana ‘the curse of the tropics,’ adding that when a man planted one
  banana tree he provided food enough for himself and his descendants to
  the tenth generation, in a climate where there is no real necessity for
  clothes.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Ed. “Somebody once said that ‘every man is as lazy as
  he dares to be.’”</p>
<p>“Well, I am, anyhow,” yawned Irv, “and so I’m going up on deck under the
  awning to make up some of that sleep I lost last night.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">SCUTTLE CHATTER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pocket in which <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> lay
  at anchor was well out of the path of passing steamboats. It was also pretty
  free from drift-wood, except of the smaller sort. So there was nothing
  of any consequence to be done during the two days of waiting. It was necessary
  to pump a little now and then, as the very tightest boat will let in a
  little bilge water, especially when she is as heavily loaded as this one
  was. There were what Irv Strong called “the inevitable three meals a day”
  to get, but beyond that there was nothing whatever to do.</p>
<p>Ed’s books were a good deal in demand at this time. Irv and Phil managed
  to do some swimming in spite of the drift-wood and the coldness of the
  water. For the rest, the boys lounged about on the deck, with now and then
  a “long talk” at the scuttle or in the cabin if it rained. Their “long
  talks” on deck were always held around the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> scuttle,
  so that the one on guard over Hughes might take part in them. There were
  only five steps to the little ladder that led from deck to cabin, and by
  sitting on the middle one the boy on guard could keep his feet on the edge
  of the prisoner’s bunk and let his head protrude above the deck.</p>
<p>They had naturally been thinking a good deal about what Ed had told them
  concerning food, and now and then a question would arise in the mind of
  one or another of them which would set the conversation going again.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” said Will Moreraud, “how men first found out what things were
  good to eat?”</p>
<p>“By trying them, I guess,” said Phil. “I read in a book somewhere that
  whenever the primitive man saw a new beast he asked first, ‘can he eat
  me?’ and next, ‘can I eat him?’”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed, “and that sort of thing continued until our own time,
  when science came in to help us. You know where the jimson weed got its
  name, don’t you?”</p>
<p>None of them had ever heard.</p>
<p>“Well, ‘jimson’ is only a corruption of ‘Jamestown.’ When the early settlers
  landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> at
  Jamestown they found so many new kinds of grain, and animals, and plants
  that they began trying them to see which were good and which were not.
  Among other things they thought the burs of the jimson weed—the poisonous
  thorn-apple of stramonium—looked rather inviting. So they boiled a lot
  of the burs and ate them. Like idiots, they didn’t confine the experiment
  to one man, or better still ‘try it on a dog,’ but set to work, a lot of
  them at once, to eat the stuff. It poisoned them, of course, and made a
  great sensation in Jamestown. So they named the plant the Jamestown weed.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” said Irv, “my grandfather telling me that when he was young,
  people thought tomatoes were poisonous, and he said it took a long time
  for those that tried them to teach other people better.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I had in my mind,” said Ed, “when I said that there was no
  known way to find out whether things were good to eat or not except by
  trying them, till modern science came to our aid.”</p>
<p>“How does modern science manage it?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Well, if any new fruit or vegetable should turn up now, a chemist would
  analyze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> it
  to find out just what it was composed of. Then the doctors who make a study
  of such things would ‘try it on a dog,’ or more likely on a rabbit or guinea
  pig, to find out if it had any value as a medicine. They try every new
  substance in that way in fact, whether it is an original substance just
  discovered or some new compound. They even tried nitro-glycerine, and found
  it to be a very valuable medicine. So, too, they have got some of our most
  valuable drugs from coal oil, simply by trying them.”</p>
<p>“Good for modern science!” said Phil. “But, Ed, what were the other new
  things the colonists found in this country?”</p>
<p>“There were many. But those that have proved of most importance are corn,
  tobacco, tomatoes, watermelons, turkeys, Irish potatoes, and sweet potatoes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come now,” said Irv, raising his head and resting it on his hand,
  “you said <i>Irish</i> potatoes.”</p>
<p>“And why not? They are a very important product, and the crop of them
  sells for many millions of—”</p>
<p>“<i>But</i> they didn’t originate in this country, did they? Weren’t they
  brought here from Ireland?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>“Not at all. They were taken from here to Ireland.”</p>
<p>“Then why are they called Irish potatoes?”</p>
<p>“Because they proved to be so much the most profitable crop the Irish
  people could raise that they soon came to be the chief crop grown there.
  I don’t know whether the colonists found any of them growing wild in Virginia
  or not. They are supposed to have originated in South America and Mexico.
  At any rate, they are strictly native Americans. By the way,” said Ed,
  “the people who thought tomatoes poisonous were not so very far out in
  their reckoning. Both the tomato and the potato are plants belonging to
  the deadly nightshade family, and the vines of both contain a virulent
  poison.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps somebody tried tomato vines for greens,” said Phil, “and got
  himself ready for the coroner before the tomatoes had time to grow and
  ripen.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t unlikely,” said Ed. “At any rate, an experiment of that kind
  would have gone far to give the fruit a bad name.”</p>
<p>“However that may be,” said Irv, “it is pretty certain that men must have
  found out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> what
  was and what wasn’t good to eat mainly by trying. There’s salt now. It
  is the only mineral substance that men everywhere eat. All the rest of
  our foods are either animal or vegetable.”</p>
<p>“And that’s a puzzle,” replied Ed. “Man must have got a very early taste
  of salt, or else there wouldn’t be any man.”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“Why, the human animal simply can’t live without salt. He digests his
  food by means of an acid which he gets from salt, and from nothing else
  whatever. So he must have had salt from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“The Garden of Eden must have been a seaport then,” mused Phil. “Adam
  and Eve probably boiled their new potatoes in water dipped up from the
  docks.”</p>
<p>The boys laughed, and Ed continued:—</p>
<p>“It is a curious fact that the ancients, even as late as Greek times,
  knew nothing about sugar; at least, in its pure state. They got a good
  deal of it in fruits and vegetables, of course, and the Greeks used honey
  very lavishly. They not only ate it, but they made an intoxicating liquor
  out of it which they called mead. But of sugar, pure and simple, they knew
  nothing whatever. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> language
  hasn’t even a word for it. Yet in our time sugar is one of the most important
  products in the world, so important that many nations pay large bounties
  to encourage its cultivation.”</p>
<p>“By the way,” asked Phil, after a few moments’ meditation, “what is the
  most important crop in this country?”</p>
<p>“Wheat”—“cotton,” answered Will and Constant respectively.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ed, “corn is very much our most important crop.”</p>
<p>“More so than wheat?”</p>
<p>“Four to one and more,” said Ed. “Our corn crop amounts to about two thousand
  million bushels every year—often greatly more. Our wheat crop averages
  about five hundred million bushels. And as corn has more food value in
  it, pound for pound, than wheat has, it is easy to see that not only for
  us, but for all the world, our corn crop is quite four to one more important
  than our wheat.”</p>
<p>“But I thought corn wasn’t eaten much except in this country?” queried
  Irv. “The Germans and French and English don’t eat it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t they, though?” asked Ed, with a quizzical look. “Don’t they eat
  enormous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> quantities
  of American pork, bacon, and beef? And what is that but American corn in
  another shape?”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Irv, this time sitting bolt upright. “I’ve heard that
  the big farmers all over the West keep tab on the price of meat and corn.
  If meat is high and corn low, they bring up all their hogs from the woods,
  fatten them on the corn and sell them. But if meat is low or corn high,
  they sell the corn.”</p>
<p>“And they know to the nicest fraction of a pound,” added Ed, “how much
  corn it takes to make a given amount of pork.”</p>
<p>“Well, even if we didn’t sell any corn at all to other nations,” said
  Phil, “I should think our crop would help them. <i>We</i> eat a great deal
  of it, and if we hadn’t it, we’d eat just so much wheat instead, and so
  we should have just that much less wheat to sell to them.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Ed. “Every thing that feeds a man in any country leaves
  precisely that much more to feed other men with in other countries.”</p>
<p>“And what a lot it does take to feed a man!” exclaimed Will.</p>
<p>“Not so much as you probably imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>”
  said Ed. “A robust man requires about a pound and a half of meat and a
  pound and a half of bread per day. Vegetables are simply substitutes for
  bread and cost about the same. Eggs, milk, etc., take the place of meat
  and cost less. So by reckoning on three pounds of food a day, half meat
  and half bread, or their equivalents, we find that a strong, healthy, hard-working
  man can be fed at a cost of about fifteen cents a day. The coarser and
  more nutritious parts of beef and mutton and good sound pork can be bought
  at retail at an average of eight cents a pound—often much less. The man’s
  meat, therefore, will cost him twelve cents a day or less. Good flour can
  be had at about two cents a pound. The man’s bread will, therefore, cost
  him about three cents a day, making the total cost of his food about fifteen
  cents a day, or less than fifty-five dollars a year.”</p>
<p>“But it costs something to cook it,” said Phil.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not much. I have calculated only the actual cost of the raw
  materials, but my figures are too high rather than too low, for corned
  beef and chuck steaks are often sold at retail as low as three or four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> cents
  a pound, and neck pieces, heads, hearts, livers, and kidneys even lower,
  while I have allowed eight cents a pound as an average price for all the
  meat that the man eats. Now, allowing for the cost of cooking and for unavoidable
  waste, I reckon that a strong, healthy American citizen can feed himself
  abundantly on less than seventy-five dollars a year.”</p>
<p>“But what if he can’t get the seventy-five dollars?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“In this country any man in tolerable health can get it easily. There
  is no excuse in this country for what somebody calls ‘the poverty that
  suffers,’ at any rate among people who have health. Why, one hundred dollars
  a year is a good deal less than thirty cents a day, and anybody can earn
  that.”</p>
<p>“What does cause ‘the poverty that suffers,’ then?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Drink, mainly,” broke in Phil.</p>
<p>“By the way,” said Irv, looking up from some figures he had been making,
  “does it occur to you that our corn crop alone, even if we produced nothing
  else in the world, would furnish food enough for all the people in this
  country?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>“No; how do you figure it, Irv?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Why, Ed says the corn crop amounts to 2,000,000,000 bushels. There are
  56 pounds in a bushel, or 112,000,000,000 pounds in the crop. That would
  give every man, woman, and child in our 70,000,000 population 1600 pounds
  of corn per year, or pretty nearly four and a half pounds apiece each day
  in the year, while Ed says no man needs more than three pounds of food
  per day. So the corn crop, whether eaten as bread or partly in the shape
  of meat, furnishes a great deal more food than the American people can
  possibly eat. No wonder we ship such vast quantities of foodstuffs abroad!”</p>
<p>“That’s encouraging,” said Phil; “but it’s bedtime. Hie ye to your bunks!
  Whose watch is it?”</p>
<p>And so the scuttle chatter ended.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">AT MEMPHIS</p>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> ten or twenty miles above Memphis the
  flatboat met a steamboat. It was out looking for the flatboat. Not only
  had bank officers and law officers arrived at Memphis, but they had become
  so apprehensive at the delay of the flatboat that they had chartered the
  steamboat and gone in search of her.</p>
<p>One of the bank officers came aboard, and to him Phil explained the situation,
  receiving in return the warmest congratulations upon the capture.</p>
<p>“We’ll take you in tow,” said the bank officer. “That will hurry matters,
  and we’ve men waiting at the wharf with all the necessary papers and arrest
  warrants.”</p>
<p>“But you must land us above or below the town,” said Phil.</p>
<p>“Why? Why not at the wharf?”</p>
<p>“Because we’re making this voyage as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> cheaply
  as possible, and mustn’t pay any unnecessary wharfage fees.”</p>
<p>“Wharfage fees be hanged!” replied the man. “I’ll take care of all that.
  Why, I’d pay your wharfage fees at every landing from here to New Orleans.
  I’d buy your flatboat and all her cargo ten times over. Why, my boy, you
  don’t know what a big piece of work you’ve done, or how grateful we are.
  Wharfage fees!” with an accent of amused disgust. “What are wharfage fees
  when you’ve caught the fellow and secured the plunder? And even that isn’t
  the best of it. The letters you’ve got”—for Phil had outlined their contents
  in his telegram to Cincinnati—“have enabled us to arrest the whole gang
  already. We’ve got ’em all, and you’re entitled to the credit of enabling
  us to break up the strongest band of bank robbers that was ever organized
  in this country. So—” signalling to the steamer—“send a line aboard and
  we’ll be at Memphis in an hour or two. In the meantime you and your companions
  must take breakfast on the steamboat.”</p>
<p>The flatboat was quickly made fast at the side of the steamer, and three
  of the boys went aboard for breakfast, the other two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> following
  when the first three returned. For until all legal forms should be completed,
  and Jim Hughes safely delivered to the officers of the law, Phil had no
  notion of leaving that worthy or the flatboat holding him, in charge of
  anybody except himself or his comrades. When he himself went to breakfast,
  he left Irv Strong in command, with Constant for his assistant, and Ed
  as guard over Hughes in the cabin.</p>
<p>At Memphis the legal formalities were conducted on the part of the boys
  by a lawyer whom Phil employed to see to it that their interests should
  be guarded. They lay there for two days. Jim Hughes was delivered to the
  authorities. The reward of five thousand dollars was paid over to Phil
  in currency. He divided the money equally among the crew. But as it would
  never do to carry so great a sum with them on the flatboat, they converted
  it into drafts on New York, which all the boys sent to the bank in Vevay,
  the money to be held there till their return.</p>
<p>As to supplies for the flatboat, the Cincinnati banker made some lavish
  gifts. He sent on board fresh beef enough to last several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> days,
  four hams, two strips of bacon, two pieces of dried beef, ten pounds of
  coffee, five pounds of tea, a bag of flour, a sack of salt, a dozen loaves
  of fresh bread, a big box of crackers, five pounds of butter, a basket
  of eggs, two or three cases of canned vegetables and fruits, some canned
  soups, a large can of milk packed in ice, a sack of dried beans, a bunch
  of bananas, a box of oranges, and finally, a large, iced cake with miniature
  American flags stuck all over it.</p>
<p>“I can talk now,” said Hughes to Ed, after the law officers had received
  and handcuffed him; “and I’ve got just one thing to say. I never had anything
  against any of you fellows except that brother Phil of yours. But for his
  meddling, I’d be a free man now. I’ve ‘got it in for’ him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, as to that,” drawled Irv Strong, “by the time you’ve served your
  ten or twenty years in State Prison, I imagine Phil will be sufficiently
  grown up to hold his own with you. He’s a ‘pretty sizable’ fellow even
  now, for his age.”</p>
<p>“Tell us something more interesting, Jim,” said Will Moreraud. “Tell us
  why you tried to run us on Vevay Bar and again on Craig’s Bar.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>“I didn’t try to run you on them. I tried to run you behind them into
  the Kentucky shore channel.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I was in a hurry to get down the river, and I didn’t want you to
  make that long stop at Craig’s Landing. If I could have run you behind
  those bars, you’d have been at Carrollton before you could pull up, and
  of course it wouldn’t have paid you to get the boat towed back up the river.
  I was trying to hurry, that’s all; and I knew the river better than Captain
  Phil suspected.”</p>
<p>That was all of farewell there was between the crew of <i>The Last of
    the Flatboats</i> and her late pilot. When some one suggested to Phil
    that he should speak for the party and express regret at the necessity
    that had governed their course, Phil said:—</p>
<p>“But I don’t feel the least regret. I am glad we’ve secured him and his
  gang. It restores a lot of plunder to the people to whom it belongs; it
  breaks up a very dangerous band of burglars; and it will help teach other
  persons of that kind how risky it is to live by law-breaking. Perhaps it
  will help to keep many people honest. No, I’m not sorry that we’ve been
  able to render<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> so
  great a service to the public, and I’m not going to pretend that I am.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Phil,” said Ed.</p>
<p>“Of course he is,” said Irv; “and as for Jim Hughes, he will get only
  what he deserves. If there were no laws, or if they were not enforced by
  the punishment of crime, there wouldn’t be much ‘show’ for honest people
  in this world.”</p>
<p>“There wouldn’t be any honest people, I reckon,” said Will, “for honest
  people simply couldn’t live. Everybody would have to turn savage and robber,
  or starve to death.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed. “That’s how law originated, and civilization is simply
  a state of existence in which there are laws enough to restrain wrong.
  When the savage finds that he can’t defend himself single-handed against
  murder and robbery, he joins with other savages for that purpose. That
  makes a tribe. It must have rules to govern it, and they are laws. It is
  out of the tribal organization that all civilized society has grown, mainly
  by the making of better and better laws, or by the better and better enforcement
  of laws already made.”</p>
<p>“Then are we all savages, restrained only by law from indulging in every
  sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> crime?”
  asked Phil. “I, for one, don’t feel myself to be in that condition of mind.”</p>
<p>“By no means,” replied the elder boy. “We are the products of habit and
  heredity. We have lost most of our savage instincts by having restrained
  them through generations, just as cows and dogs have done. You see, it
  is a law of nature that parents are apt to transmit their own characteristics
  to their children. As one of the great scientific writers puts it, ‘the
  habit of one generation is the instinct of the next.’ If you want a dog
  to hunt with, you choose one whose ancestors have been in the habit of
  hunting, because you know that he has inherited the habit as an instinct.
  Yet the highest-bred setters, pointers, and fox hounds are all descended
  ultimately from a common ancestry of wild dogs, as fierce, probably, as
  any wolf ever was. They have been for many generations under law,—the law
  of man’s control,—and so they have not only lost their wildness, but have
  acquired new instincts, new capacities, and a new intelligence.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Phil, meditatively. “It is a long-continued course of timely
  spanking that has slowly changed us from savages into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> fellows
  able to run a flatboat and inclined to wear trousers.”</p>
<p>“Ah, as to that,” said Irv, “we haven’t quite got rid of our savage instincts
  even yet. I for one am savagely hungry for some of that beef our Cincinnati
  friend sent on board, and I suspect the rest of the tribe are in the same
  condition.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A WRESTLE WITH THE RIVER</p>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the boat left Memphis it was necessary
  to proceed with a good deal of caution. A new flood had come down the river,
  bringing with it a dangerous drift of uprooted trees and the like. Moreover,
  in many places there were strong currents setting out from the natural
  river-bed into the overflowed regions on either side, and constant care
  was necessary to avoid being drawn into these.</p>
<p>Memphis is built upon the high Chickasaw bluffs, but a little way farther
  down the river the country becomes low and flat, and in parts it grows
  steadily lower as it recedes from the river, so that at some distance inland
  the plantations and woodlands lie actually lower than the bed of the great
  river. It has been said, indeed, with a good deal of truth, that the Mississippi
  River runs along on the top of a ridge.</p>
<p>“How did it come to do that?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> Will.
  “Why didn’t it find its level as water generally does—”</p>
<p>“And as men ought to do, but usually don’t,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“It did at first, of course,” said Ed. “But whenever it got on a rampage
  like this, it took all the region along its course for its right of way.
  It spread itself out over the country and went whithersoever it chose.
  Then came men who wanted its rich bottom lands for farms. So they built
  earth levees to keep the river off their lands. As more and more lands
  were brought under cultivation, more and more of these embankments were
  built, and the river was more and more restrained. Now there is nothing
  in the world that resists and resents restraint more than water does. So
  the river breaks through the levees every now and then and floods the plantations,
  drowning cattle, sweeping away crops and houses, and creating local famines
  that must be relieved from the outside.”</p>
<p>Before beginning his explanation Ed had dipped up a glassful of the river
  water and set it on the deck. It was thick with mud, so that it looked
  more like water from a hog wallow than water from a river. He turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> now
  and gently took up the glass. There was a deep sediment in the bottom and
  the water above was beginning to grow somewhat clearer.</p>
<p>“Look here,” said the boy. “If we let that water sit still long enough,
  all the mud would sink to the bottom and the water above would become clear.
  That’s what we should have to do with our drinking and cooking water on
  this boat if we hadn’t brought a filter along. Now you see that the water
  of this river is carrying more mud than it can keep dissolved. This mud
  is sinking to the bottom all the way from St. Louis to New Orleans. It
  is building up the bottom, raising it year by year, and so raising the
  river higher and higher. When the river was left free, the same thing happened,
  but whenever a flood came it would leave its built-up bed, run over its
  banks, and cut new channels for itself in the lowest country it could find.
  There are many lakes and ponds well away from the present river that were
  obviously a part of the channel once.</p>
<p>“When men began confining the river within its banks at all but the highest
  stages of water, and in many places at all stages, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> couldn’t
  leave its old channels for new ones, no matter how much it had built up
  the bottom, and so the bed of the river steadily rose from year to year.
  That made the surface of the flood water higher, and so men had to build
  higher and higher levees to keep the floods from burying their plantations.
  As they have nothing better to make their embankments out of than the soft
  sandy loam of the bottom lands, the levees are not very strong at best,
  and the higher they are raised, the greater is the water pressure against
  them when the river is up. So they often give way, and when they do that
  the river rushes through the gap, or crevasse, as it is called, rapidly
  widening and deepening it, and pouring a torrent over all the country within
  reach. In such a flood as this men are kept watching the levees day and
  night to stop every little leak, lest it become a crevasse, and it is often
  necessary to forbid steamboats to pass near the shore, because the swells
  they make would wash over the tops of the levees and start crevasses in
  that way. Sometimes a strong wind pushes the water up enough to break a
  levee and destroy hundreds of lives and millions of dollars’ worth of property,
  for when a levee breaks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> the
  region behind it is flooded too rapidly to permit much more than escape
  alive, and often it doesn’t permit even that.”</p>
<p>“What a destructive old demon this river is!” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Yes, at times,” replied the elder boy. “But it does a lot of good work
  as well as bad. It created all the lands that it overflows, and if man
  tries to rob it of its own, I don’t see why it is to be blamed for defending
  its possessions.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean that it created all the lands that it overflows?” asked
  Constant, who always wanted to learn all he could.</p>
<p>“Why, the geologists say that the Gulf of Mexico used to extend to Cairo,
  covering all the flat region in the Mississippi Valley south, except here
  and there a high spot like that on which Memphis stands. The high spots
  were islands in the Gulf.”</p>
<p>“But where did the land come from then?”</p>
<p>“Why, the Mississippi built it with its mud. It carries enough mud at
  all times to make half a state, if it were all brought together. When the
  river’s mouth was at Cairo, the river kept pouring mud into the Gulf. The
  mud sank, and in that way the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> shore-line
  was extended farther and farther south, spreading to the right and left
  as it went. The river is still doing this down at its mouth below New Orleans,
  and it has been doing it for millions of years. It has simply filled in
  all that part of the Gulf that once covered eastern Arkansas, Louisiana,
  Mississippi, and the lower parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri.”</p>
<p>“But why don’t other rivers do the same thing?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“They do, in a degree,” said Ed. “You know there is always a bar in the
  sea just off the mouth of a river.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Well, most rivers carry very little mud in their water, and that little
  goes to make the bar at the mouth. The Mississippi carries so much mud
  that its bars become land, and the river cuts a channel through them, carrying
  its mud still farther into the sea. Then again, the Mississippi has floods
  every year or twice a year, and in some years three times, such as most
  rivers never have. This is because it carries in a single channel the water
  from twenty-eight states and a territory, as we saw on the map one day
  up the river. Now as soon as the river mud forms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> a
  bar that shows above water, vegetation begins to grow on it. When the next
  flood comes, it covers the new-made land and builds it higher by depositing
  a great deal more mud on top of it and among the vegetation, which, by
  checking the current at the bottom, helps the mud to lodge there. In that
  way, all the lowlands for hundreds of miles along this river were created.
  It took hundreds of thousands of years—perhaps millions of years—to do
  it, but it was done.”</p>
<p>Ed did not give this long explanation all in one speech. He was interrupted
  many times by Phil’s call of all hands to the sweeps, when rowing was necessary,
  and by other matters of duty, which it has not been necessary to detail
  here.</p>
<p>Whenever it was possible to land the boat for the night, the boys did
  so, and when no banks were in sight where a mooring could be made, they
  sought for some bend or pocket reasonably free from the more dangerous
  kinds of drift, and came to anchor for safety during the hours of darkness.
  Navigation was difficult and perilous now even in daytime when they could
  make out the course of the river by sight and keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> away
  from treacherous shore currents, for the drift was very heavy. By night
  it was doubly dangerous.</p>
<p>Even in the daytime Phil kept the entire crew on deck at all times except
  when one of them went below to prepare food. Their meals were eaten on
  deck with a broad plank for table, even when it rained heavily, as it very
  often did. They slept on deck, too, under a rude shelter made of the tarpaulin.
  All this Phil regarded as necessary under the circumstances. Even when
  tied up to the trees or anchored in the snuggest cove to be found, it was
  sometimes necessary to jump into skiffs and “fend off” great threatening
  masses of drift. To this duty the calls were very frequent indeed.</p>
<p>Poor Phil got scarcely any sleep at all during these trying days and nights.
  The sense of responsibility was so strong upon him that he scarcely dared
  relax his personal watchfulness for a moment. But under the urgent pleadings
  of his comrades he would now and then leave another on duty in his place
  and throw himself down for a nap. He did this only when the conditions
  seemed most favorable, and usually even then he was up again within the
  half hour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>The escapes of the boat from damage or destruction were many and narrow,
  even under this ceaseless watching, and the strain at last began to show
  its effects upon the tough nerves of Captain Phil. He almost lived upon
  strong coffee. The coffee was an excellent thing for him under the circumstances,
  but his neglect to take other food was a dangerous mistake. He was still
  strong of body, but he was growing nervous and even a trifle irritable.</p>
<p>His comrades remonstrated with him for not sleeping, and begged him to
  eat.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to eat, I tell you,” he said, with much irritation in his
  voice.</p>
<p>“But you’ll break down, Phil, if you keep this up,” said Ed, “and then
  where shall <i>we</i> be? Without your judgment and quickness to see the
  right thing at a critical moment this boat would have gone to the bottom
  days ago. We <i>need</i> you, old fellow.”</p>
<p>The boys all joined in the pleading, and Phil at last sat down with them
  and tried to eat, but could not.</p>
<p>“No, no, don’t drink any coffee yet,” said Will, almost pulling the cup
  out of his hands. “It’ll kill the little appetite you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>’ve
  got. Eat first, and drink your coffee afterward.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said Irv, stretching out his long legs, and with a spring
  rising to his feet. “Wait a minute, and I’ll play Ganymede, the cup-bearer.”</p>
<p>He went below, where he broke an egg in a large soda-water glass and whipped
  it up with an egg-beater. Then he filled the glass with milk, of which
  they still had a gallon or so left, and again using the egg-beater, whipped
  the whole into a lively froth, adding a little salt to give it flavor and
  make it more digestible.</p>
<p>“Here, Phil,” he said, as he reappeared on deck, “drink this. You’ll find
  it good, and it is food of the very best sort, as well as drink.”</p>
<p>Phil took the glass, tasted its contents, and then drained it at a draught.</p>
<p>“Make me another, won’t you, Irv?” said Phil about five minutes later;
  “somehow that one has got lonely and wants a companion.”</p>
<p>Irv was glad enough to do so, and by the time Phil had slowly swallowed
  his second glass, he not only felt himself fed, but he was so. His nerves
  grew steady again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> there
  was no further irritation in his voice, and by the time that the next meal
  was ready the boy had regained his appetite.</p>
<p>The boat came to anchor for the night a little after supper, and as the
  anchorage was particularly well protected behind a heavily timbered point
  of submerged land, Phil consented to take a longer sleep than he had done
  for several days past.</p>
<p>Irv and Constant remained on duty for several hours, after which Ed and
  Will took their places. Only twice during the night did Phil awake. Each
  time he arose, went all around the deck, inspecting the situation, and
  then lay down again upon the boards.</p>
<p>By morning he was quite himself again.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">IN THE FOG</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boat was now in a part of the river where
  the land on both sides lies very low, behind very high levees. These are
  the richest cotton lands in the world, and their owners have tried to reclaim
  all of them from the river floods instead of taking only part of them for
  cultivation. Along other parts of the stream there are levees only here
  and there, leaving the river a chance to spread out over great areas of
  unreclaimed land, thus relieving the levees of much of the pressure upon
  them. Here, however, the line of embankment is continuous on both sides
  of the stream. For long distances the river is held between the two lines
  of artificially made banks.</p>
<p>The water was now within a few inches of the top of the levees, and twenty
  or thirty feet above the level of the lands in the rear. The strain upon
  the embankments was almost inconceivably great, while the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> which
  any break in that long line of earthworks would involve was appalling even
  to think of.</p>
<p>The boys could see gangs of men at work wherever any weakness showed itself
  in the embankments, while sentinels, armed with shotguns, were everywhere
  on guard to prevent mischief-makers from cutting the levees. For, incredible
  as it may seem, men have sometimes been base enough to do this in order
  to let the river out of its banks, and thus reduce the danger of a break
  farther up stream where their own interests lay. For, of course, when a
  crevasse occurs at any point it lets so much water run suddenly out of
  the banks that the river falls several inches for many miles above, and
  the strain on the levees is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>As the boys were floating down the middle of the flood, watching the work
  on the levees with keen interest, the air began to grow thick. A few minutes
  later a great bank of dense fog settled down upon them, covering all things
  as with a blanket. The shores and the great trees that grew upon them were
  blotted out. Then as the fog grew thicker and thicker, even the river disappeared,
  except a little patch of it immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> around
  the boat. On every side was an impenetrable wall of mist, and ragged fragments
  of it floated across the deck so that when they stood half the boat’s length
  apart the boys looked like spectres to each other.</p>
<p>“I say, Phil, hadn’t we better go ashore or anchor?” said Constant.</p>
<p>“Where is the shore?” asked Phil, quietly.</p>
<p>“Why, there’s a shore on each side of us.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. But in what direction? Which way is across the river, which
  way up the river, which way down the river?”</p>
<p>“Why, the current will tell that,” said Constant.</p>
<p>“How are we going to find out which way the current runs?” asked Phil,
  with a quizzical smile.</p>
<p>“Easy enough; by looking at the driftwood floating by,” said the boy,
  going to the side of the boat to peer at the surface of the river through
  the fog. Presently he called out in amazement:—</p>
<p>“Why, the whole thing has stopped—the drift, the river, and the flatboat!
  We’re lying here just as still as if we were on solid ground.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>“On the contrary,” said Phil, “we’re floating down stream at the rate
  of several miles an hour.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Think a minute, Constant,” said Phil. “We are floating just as fast as
  the river runs. The drift-wood is doing the same thing. The water, the
  drift, and the flatboat are all moving in the same direction at precisely
  the same speed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” said Constant, with an astonished look in his eyes. “We’ve
  nothing to measure by. We can’t tell which way we’re going, or how fast,
  or anything about it.”</p>
<p>“Why not come to anchor, then?” asked Irv. “If we keep on floating, nobody
  knows where we may go to. If there should be any gap in the line of levees
  anywhere, we might float into it. It would just tickle this flatboat to
  slip off on an expedition of that sort. Why not anchor till the fog lifts?”</p>
<p>“First, because we can’t,” said Phil. “The water is much too deep. But
  even if we could, it would be the very worst thing we could do. It would
  bring us to a standstill, while everything else afloat would keep on swirling
  past us, some of it running into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> us.
  If we should anchor here in the strong current, <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> would
  soon have as many holes in her as a colander.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you intend to do, Phil?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Precisely nothing whatever,” answered the young captain. “Anything we
  might do would probably make matters worse. You see we were almost exactly
  in the middle of the river when the fog came down on us. Now, if we do
  nothing, the chances are that the current will carry us along somewhere
  near the middle, or at least well away from the shores. If it don’t, we
  can’t help it. The only thing we can do is to keep as close a watch as
  we can all around the boat, for we don’t know which end or which side of
  her is in front now. I want one fellow to go to the bow, one to the stern,
  and one to each side, and watch. If we are about to run into a bank or
  anything else, call out, and we may save ourselves at the last minute.
  That’s all we can do for the present. So go now!”</p>
<p>The wisdom of Phil’s decision to do nothing except watch alertly was clear
  to all his comrades, so they took the places he had assigned them, while
  he busied himself first at one point and then at another, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> all
  the while whether there might not be something else that he could do—some
  precaution not yet thought of that he could take. He went to the pump now
  and then and worked it till no more water came up. He went below two or
  three times to see that nothing was wrong with the cargo. The boys, meanwhile,
  were walking back and forth on their beats, each carrying a boat-hook with
  which to “fend off” the larger bits of drift which the eddies, cross currents,
  and those strange disturbances in the stream called “boils,” sometimes
  drove against the gunwales.</p>
<p>The “boils” referred to are peculiar to the Mississippi, I believe. They
  are whirlpools, caused by the conflict of cross currents, and, as Will
  Moreraud said during this day of close watching, they are “sometimes right
  side up and sometimes upside down.” That is to say, sometimes a current
  from beneath comes to the surface like water in a boiling kettle and seems
  to pile itself up in a sort of mound for a half minute or so, while sometimes
  there is a genuine whirlpool strong enough even to suck a skiff down, as
  old-time flatboatmen used to testify.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>These were anxious hours for the young captain and his crew, but worse
  was to come. For night fell at last with the fog still on, and between
  the fog and the darkness it was no longer possible to see even the water
  at the sides of the boat from the deck.</p>
<p>The crew had eaten no dinner that day. They had forgotten all about their
  meals in the eagerness of their watching. Now that watching was no longer
  possible they remembered their appetites, and had an evening dinner instead
  of supper.</p>
<p>They set their lights of course, though it was of little use from any
  point of view. They could not be seen at a distance of twenty yards, and
  moreover there was nobody to see them.</p>
<p>“There’s not much danger of any steamboat running into us now,” said Phil,
  who had carefully thought the matter out.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Because this fog has lasted for nearly twelve hours now, and by this
  time every steamboat is tied up to some bank or tree. For no pilot would
  think of running in such a cloud after finding any shore to which he could
  make his boat fast.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>“But how can a steamboat find the shore when we can’t?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Because she can keep running till she finds it; and if she runs slowly
  she can back when she finds it till she makes an easy landing. She has
  power, and power gives her control of herself. We have none, except what
  the sweeps give us. In fogs like this steamboats always hunt for the shores
  and tie up till the fog lifts. So after ten or twelve hours of it, there
  are no steamboats prowling around to run into us.”</p>
<p>“Another advantage the steamboats have in hunting for the shore,” said
  Will, “is that they can blow their whistles and listen for echoes. They
  can tell in that way not only in which direction the shore is, but about
  how far away it is.”</p>
<p>“How do steamships manage in fogs out at sea?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“Theoretically,” replied Ed, “they slow down and blow their whistles or
  their ‘sirens,’ as they call the big steam fog-horns that can be heard
  for many miles. But in fact the big ocean steamships drive ahead at full
  speed—twenty miles an hour or more—blowing their sirens—till they hear
  some other ship’s siren. Then they act according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> to
  fixed rules, each ship turning her helm to port—that is to say to the left—so
  that they sail well away from each other.”</p>
<p>“But what if there are sailing vessels in the way?”</p>
<p>“They also have fog-horns, but they sometimes get themselves run down
  by steamships, and once in a great while one of them runs into the side
  of a steamship. The Cunard steamer <i>Oregon</i> was sunk in that way by
  a sailing craft. That sort of thing would happen oftener if the big steamships
  were to stop or run very slowly in fog. By running at full speed they make
  it pretty sure that they will themselves do any running down that is to
  be done. With their enormous weight and great speed they can cut a sailing
  vessel in two without much danger of serious damage to themselves, and
  as they have hundreds of people on board while a sailing ship has a very
  few, the steamship captains hold that it is right to shift the danger in
  that way.”</p>
<p>The night dragged slowly along. Now and then a little conversation would
  spring up, for the boys were sleeping very little, but often there would
  be no word spoken for an hour at a time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>The fog made the air very chill, and the boys, who remained on deck all
  night, had to stir about frequently to keep reasonably warm.</p>
<p>The fog began whitening at last as the daylight dawned, and all the boys
  strained their eyes to see through it.</p>
<p>But it showed no sign of lifting.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THROUGH THE CREVASSE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the daylight increased, it became possible
  to see a little further into the fog, and there was now a little air stirring
  in fitful fashion, which tore holes in the thick bank of mist, but only
  for a moment or two at a time.</p>
<p>Through one of these brief openings Phil presently made a startling discovery.
  The flatboat was running at an exceedingly rapid rate along a nearly overflowed
  levee on the Mississippi side of the river, and within fifty or sixty feet
  of it. The crest of the embankment rose only a few inches above the level
  of the water, and the current was swifter than any that Phil had seen since
  the flatboat had left the falls of the Ohio behind. What it all meant Phil
  did not know, nor could he imagine how or why the boat had drifted out
  of the main current to the shore in this way; but he felt that there was
  danger there, and calling his comrades to the sweeps, made every effort
  to regain the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> outer
  reaches of the river. But try as they might at the oars, the boat persisted
  in hugging the bank, while her speed seemed momentarily to increase. Men
  on the levee were calling to Phil, but so excitedly that he could not make
  out their meaning.</p>
<p>Presently there was another little break in the fog-bank, and Phil saw
  what was the matter. Just ahead of the boat the levee had given way, and
  the river was plunging like a Niagara through a crevasse, already two or
  three hundred feet wide, and growing wider with every second. The boat
  had been caught in the current leading to the crevasse, and was now being
  drawn into the swirling rapid.</p>
<p>Phil had hardly time to realize the situation before the boat began whirling
  about madly, and a moment later she plunged head foremost through the crevasse
  and out into the seething waste of waters that was now overspreading fields
  and woodlands beyond. As the land here lay much lower than the surface
  of the river, and as the country had not yet had time, since the levee
  broke, to fill to anything like the river level, passing through the crevasse
  was like plunging over a cataract, and after passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> through,
  the boat was carried forward at a truly fearful speed across the fields.
  Fortunately, she encountered no obstacle. Had she struck anything in that
  mad career, the box-like craft would have been broken instantly to bits.</p>
<p>As she receded from the river she left the worst of the fog behind. It
  was possible now to see for fifty or a hundred yards in every direction,
  and what the boys saw was appalling. There were horses and cattle frantically
  struggling in the water, only to sink beneath it at last, for even the
  strongest horse could not swim far in a surging torrent like that.</p>
<p>There were cross currents of great violence too, and eddies and whirlpools
  created by the seemingly angry efforts of the water to find the lowest
  levels and occupy them. These erratic currents took possession of the boat,
  and whirled her hither and thither, until her crew lost all sense of direction
  and distance, and everything else except the necessity of clinging to the
  sweep bars to avoid being spilled overboard by the sudden careenings of
  the boat to one side and then the other, and her plungings as the water
  swept her onward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>Once they saw a human being struggling in the seething water. A moment
  later he was gone, but whether drowned or carried away to some point of
  rescue there was no way of finding out.</p>
<p>Once they swept past a stately dwelling-house, submerged except as to
  its roof; what fate had befallen its inhabitants they could never know,
  for the next instant a strong current caught the boat, and drove it, side
  first, straight toward a great barn that had been carried off its foundations
  and was now afloat. For a moment the boys expected to be driven against
  the barn with appalling violence—an event that would have meant immediate
  destruction. But the currents changed in an instant, so that the barn was
  carried in one direction and the boat in another. As the two drifted apart
  there were despairing cries from the floating building, which had been
  badly crushed in collision with something, and was in danger of falling
  to pieces at any moment. The boys looked, and caught a glimpse of a number
  of negro children clinging to the wrecked structure. An instant later the
  barn disappeared in what was left of the fog.</p>
<p>The boys were sickened by what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> had
  seen and by what they felt must be its sequel. It is a fearful thing to
  have to stand still, doing nothing, when human creatures are being carried
  to a cruel death before one’s eyes. But as yet the boys could do nothing
  except cling to their own boat. Two of their skiffs had been carried away,
  and it would have been certain death to make even an effort to launch any
  of the others.</p>
<p>They were swept on and on for miles. They had passed beyond the cultivated
  lands and out into a forest. Here the danger was greater than ever, as
  a single collision with a tree would have made an end of everything. But
  the turbulence of the water was slowly subsiding at last, and the boat
  floated, still unsteadily indeed, but with less violent plungings than
  before. It was possible now, by exercising great care, to move about a
  little, and Phil quickly seized the opportunity to get some things done
  that he deemed necessary.</p>
<p>“Irv, you and Constant go to the starboard pump,” he said hurriedly; “Ed
  and Will to the other; the boat must be badly wrenched, and she’ll fill
  with water. Pump like maniacs.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>The boys went to their posts, and managed to work the pumps, though with
  difficulty. Water came freely in answer to their efforts, showing that
  Phil’s conjecture was correct.</p>
<p>Phil himself climbed down the little companionway, receiving some bruises
  and one rather ugly cut on the head as he did so, for the sudden tossings
  of the boat still continued, though less violently than before. He found
  matters below in rather better condition than he had feared. The space
  under the flooring—or the bilge, as it is called—was full, and there was
  a good deal of water washing about above the floor. The boat was too unsteady
  for Phil to estimate the depth of the leakage, or to discover the rapidity
  with which the water was coming in. But he hoped that diligent pumping
  might yet save the craft.</p>
<p>Having hurriedly made his inspection, he proceeded next to fill a basket
  with food, taking first that which could be eaten without further cooking,—canned
  goods, dried beef, and the like,—and, returning to the deck, deposited
  his stores in one of the skiffs. He repeated this several times, till he
  had fully provisioned two of the boats.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> It
  did not require many minutes to do this, and they were minutes that he
  could not use to better advantage in any other way, for there was still
  no possibility of directing the flatboat’s course by using the oars, and
  Phil deemed it wise thus to provision the skiffs, so that if the boat should
  sink, he and his comrades, or some of them, at least, might have a chance
  of escape in them without starving before reaching dry land somewhere.</p>
<p>The boat had passed safely through the first stretch of timber lands,
  and was now floating over a broad reach of open plantation country. But
  the fog was gone now, and, as there was woodland in sight a few miles farther
  on in the direction in which the current was carrying them, Phil and his
  friends felt that their respite was likely to be a brief one.</p>
<p>He relieved Ed at the pump, and ordered him to rest. But the boy protested
  that he was still fresh, and would have worked on if Phil had permitted.
  Even in this time of danger and hurried effort, Phil could not help thinking
  how greatly his brother’s health and strength had improved.</p>
<p>“Ed’s getting well,” he said to Irv, as the two tugged at the pump.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes,” rejoined the tall fellow; “a month ago he couldn’t have done such
  work as this to save his life.”</p>
<p>“And twenty-four hours of such a fog as we’ve been through would have
  killed him to a certainty. Now he doesn’t even cough.”</p>
<p>A little later, as the boat began floating more steadily, Phil called
  out:—</p>
<p>“Go below, Ed, and see how much water is in the hold.”</p>
<p>Ed’s report convinced the young captain that the leaks were at least not
  gaining upon the pumps. An hour later, the boat having become quite steady
  again, Phil found that the pumps were gaining on the water, which by that
  time did not rise above the flooring.</p>
<p>The boat had by this time passed again into a forest, and, while the current
  was now a steady one, it was still very strong. Phil considered the situation
  carefully, and decided upon his course of action.</p>
<p>“Take a line in a skiff, Will, and pass it once around a tree, then run
  off with the end of it and hold on, letting it slip as slowly as possible
  on the tree till the boat comes to a halt. Then make fast.”</p>
<p>To the others he explained:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>“We must check her speed gradually. In such a current as this to stop
  her suddenly would sling her against some tree like a whip cracker.”</p>
<p>Then he turned to Irv, and said, “Take another line, and do the same thing
  on another tree.”</p>
<p>By the time that Irv pushed off in his skiff Will had got his line in
  place around a tree, and had rowed away fifty yards with the end of it.
  As it tightened, the rope began slipping on the tree, dragging the skiff
  toward it. Phil called to Will:—</p>
<p>“Don’t get hurt, Will! Let go your rope when you are dragged nearly to
  the tree.”</p>
<p>Will did so just in time to save himself from an ugly collision, but his
  efforts had considerably checked the flatboat’s speed, and by the time
  he let go the line Irv had the other rope around a tree and was repeating
  the operation. This second line brought the boat to a standstill, and under
  Phil’s direction she was securely made fast both bow and stern, so that
  she could not swing about in any direction.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A LITTLE AMATEUR SURGERY</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to be done now,” said Phil,
  “is to find out what damage we have suffered, and repair as much of it
  as we can.”</p>
<p>“Better begin with your head then,” said Will. “It seems to have sustained
  more damage than anything else in sight.”</p>
<p>The cut Phil had received had covered his face and shoulders with blood,
  and his head was aching severely. But he was not ready to think of himself
  yet. He must first do everything that could be done for the safety of the
  boat and crew and cargo. So he dismissed Will’s suggestion, saying:—</p>
<p>“Never mind about my head. I’ll wash the blood off when other things are
  done. There’s plenty of water, anyhow.”</p>
<p>With that he went below again to inspect. He found that the water there
  had risen since the pumps were stopped until now it stood about two inches
  above the false bottom or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> floor
  on which the cargo rested. Putting his head out through the scuttle, he
  called:—</p>
<p>“Two of you go to the pumps—one to each pump. Don’t work too hard, but
  keep up a steady pumping. As soon as the two get tired, let the other two
  take their places.”</p>
<p>He withdrew his head, but in a few moments after the pumps were started
  he thrust it out again to say:—</p>
<p>“Don’t pump so hard! You’ll break yourselves down, and we can’t afford
  that now.”</p>
<p>He went below again, lighted a lantern and made as thorough an examination
  of the boat as possible, even moving a good deal of the freight about in
  order to get at points where he suspected the principal leaks to be. Two
  of these he closed by nailing blocks of inch board over them.</p>
<p>Meantime he made frequent observations of the water mark he had set, and
  was rejoiced to find that the pumps were taking water out more rapidly
  than it was leaking in.</p>
<p>He went on deck and announced the results of his inspection.</p>
<p>“The boat is leaking, of course, but not one-half so badly as there was
  reason to fear. The bilge is full, and the water stands about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> an
  inch deep or a little less on the false bottom. But it stood two inches
  deep there an hour ago, so I expect that in another hour or so we shall
  get it down to the bilge, leaving the floor clear. It is important to do
  that quickly so that the wet part of our cargo, particularly the lower
  tier of hay bales, may have a chance to dry out. If it stays long in water,
  of course it will be badly damaged.”</p>
<p>“Well, now,” said Irv, “I’m going to take care of something else that’s
  badly damaged. Get a pair of scissors, Ed, and some rags, and help me repair
  Phil’s head.”</p>
<p>Then, taking Phil by the arm, he continued:—</p>
<p>“Come to the bow, Phil, where we can get at the water easily. It will
  require a young lake to clean you up properly. Off with your shirt, young
  man!”</p>
<p>Irv treated the matter lightly, but he did not think of it in that way
  by any means. In common with the other boys, he was deeply concerned over
  the young captain’s wound. The bleeding had long since ceased, but the
  boy’s hair was matted, his face covered, and the upper part of his clothing
  saturated with blood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>The clothing was first removed. Then with wet cloths the face and shoulders
  were hastily sponged off.</p>
<p>“Now, Ed,” said Irv, who lived, when at home, in the house with his uncle,
  a physician, and therefore knew better than any one else on the boat what
  to do for a wound, “you take the scissors and shear off Phil’s hair just
  as close to the scalp as you can, particularly around the wound. Hair is
  always full of microbes, you know.”</p>
<p>With that Irv passed through the hold and was absent for some little time.
  When he returned, he brought with him a teakettle of hot water which he
  had waited to boil, a basin, and a little box of salt.</p>
<p>“What are those for?” asked Ed, who had by this time reduced Phil to a
  condition of baldness.</p>
<p>“How much water is there above the false bottom now?” queried Phil, whose
  mind refused to be diverted from his duty as captain.</p>
<p>“The water to cleanse the wound, the salt to disinfect it, and I didn’t
  notice any water above the floor,” said Irv, replying to both questions
  in a single breath.</p>
<p>Ed laughed, but Phil eagerly asked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> “You
  mean that the water doesn’t come over the flooring at all,—that there’s
  no water above the bilge?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t observe any,” said Irv, “but I wasn’t thinking particularly
  about it. I’ll go and look again.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Phil; “I’ll go myself if you’ll get me a lantern, for it’s
  so nearly dark now that it must be quite dark inside.”</p>
<p>When the lantern came, Phil made a hurried inspection with a blanket thrown
  over his otherwise bare shoulders. Then he thrust his shaven head above
  the deck and called to the two boys at the pumps:—</p>
<p>“I say, fellows, you can stop one of the pumps now, and keep only one
  going. One of you go below and get supper. Make it a hearty one, for we
  haven’t eaten a mouthful in twenty-four hours.”</p>
<p>In the day’s excitements not one of them had thought about food, but now
  that supper was mentioned they all realized that their appetites were voracious.</p>
<p>Having given his orders, Phil submitted himself again to the hands of
  his surgeons. Irv poured some of the hot water into a basin and added a
  tablespoonful or so of salt.</p>
<p>“You see,” he explained, “the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> with
  wounds is that germs get into them, so the most important thing of all
  is to cleanse them thoroughly, and after that to keep them clean. I’m using
  boiled water”—he was sponging the wound as he talked,—“because boiling
  kills all the microbes there may be in water.”</p>
<p>“But what is the salt for?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“To disinfect the wound. You see there must be lots of microbes in it
  already, and salt kills them. That’s what we salt meat for when we wish
  to preserve it. The salt kills microbes, and so the meat keeps sound.”</p>
<p>“Then it is the presence of microbes that causes decay in meat?”</p>
<p>“Yes, or decay in anything else. If we hadn’t thrown Jim Hughes’s whiskey
  overboard, I’d wash this wound with that. It would make Phil jump, but
  it would do the work. You know nothing decays in alcohol. However, the
  salt will do, I think.”</p>
<p>When Irv had satisfied himself that the wound was sufficiently cleansed,
  he drew the edges of the cut together and held them there with sticking
  plaster.</p>
<p>“Now, Ed,” he said, “won’t you please bring me some cloths that you’ll
  find in the oven of the stove?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>Ed went at once, but wondering. When he returned, Irv finished dressing
  the wound, and all went to supper.</p>
<p>“Why did you put the rags in the oven, Irv?” asked Ed. “I noticed you
  didn’t even try to keep them warm after I brought them to you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I roasted them for the same reason that I boiled the water—to
  sterilize them.”</p>
<p>“You mean to kill the microbes?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You see everything is likely to be infested with disease germs,
  so you must never use anything about a wound without first sterilizing
  it with heat or some chemical. You can use unboiled water, of course, because
  water cleanses things anyhow, but it is better to use boiled water if you
  can get it, and every bandage should be carefully sterilized. That’s why
  I started the fire, boiled the water, and put the rags in the oven to roast.”</p>
<p>At supper Ed ate as voraciously as the rest, and the boys observed with
  satisfaction that the long fast, the very hard work, the severe strain
  of anxiety, and the prolonged exposure to the fog had in no way hurt him.
  Ed declared, indeed, that he was growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> positively
  robust, and his comrades agreed with him.</p>
<p>“What’s the programme now, Phil?” asked one of the party when supper was
  done.</p>
<p>“A good night’s sleep,” answered the young captain. “In the morning we’ll
  consider further proceedings with clear heads. One pump is sufficient to
  keep ahead of the leaks now, and we shall have to keep that going night
  and day as long as we remain afloat. So usually we’ll keep two men awake
  to alternate at the pump, but for to-night we’ll stand short watches, keeping
  only one man awake at a time. Two watches of an hour each for each of us
  will take us through the night. I’ll take the first watch, as my head is
  aching too badly to sleep yet. So get to sleep, all of you. I’ll wake one
  of you in an hour or so.”</p>
<p>The boys objected. They wanted Phil to treat himself as an invalid, and
  let them do the watching and pumping, but he was obstinate in his determination
  to do his full share. So they stretched themselves in their bunks and were
  soon sleeping the sleep of very tired but very healthy young human animals.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A VOYAGE IN THE WOODS</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was long past midnight when Phil aroused
  one of his comrades to take his place on watch and at the pump. For the
  young captain had a good deal of careful thinking to do, and he could do
  it better alone in the dark than when surrounded by his crew. Moreover,
  he knew that until his thinking should be done he could not sleep even
  if he should try.</p>
<p>“I might as well stay on deck and let the other fellows sleep,” he said
  to himself, “as to lie awake for hours in my bunk.”</p>
<p>In the morning Phil called a “council of war.”</p>
<p>“Now listen to me first, without interrupting,” he said. “I’ve thought
  out the situation as well as I can, and have made up my mind what we ought
  to do. After I’ve told you my plan and the reasons for it, you can make
  any suggestions you like, and I’ll adopt any of them that seem good to
  me.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Irv. “Let’s hear what you’ve thought and what your
  plan is. Then we’ll carry it out.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Phil. “I want you to criticise it first, so that if it’s wrong
  I can change it.”</p>
<p>“All right. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“First of all, then, we’re out here in the woods. It isn’t a comfortable
  or a proper place for a flatboat to be in, and we must get out of it as
  quickly as we can.”</p>
<p>“But how?” broke in Will. “We’re ten or twenty or maybe thirty or forty
  miles from the river, and we can’t possibly get back again.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know so well about that,” said Phil. “Of course we can’t get
  back to the river at the point where we left it. But I’m not so sure that
  we can’t get back to it somewhere else, and at any rate, I’m going to try.
  Listen, now! The water we’re in is thirty-five feet deep.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“I’ve sounded it. So we’ve plenty of water, and there is no danger of
  our going aground. But we’re not in any river, for we’re in the midst of
  the woods, and woods don’t grow in rivers. But this water that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> we’re
  in is running toward somewhere at the rate of six or eight miles a hour,
  and we must go with it. Somehow or somewhere it must run into some river,
  and that river must somewhere and somehow empty itself into the Mississippi.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“Because there isn’t anything else for it to run into, and of course it
  can’t stop running. Now my idea is this. We must cast the boat loose and
  let her float with the current. It will be very hard work to keep her from
  smashing into these big trees, but we must do all the hard work necessary.
  We’ll tie up every night so long as we’re in the woods, and we’ll float
  all day. Sooner or later we’ll run out of the woods and into a river, and
  when we do that we’ll follow the river to its end, wherever it may happen
  to be.”</p>
<p>“But have you any idea where we are?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“No,” said Phil, “except that we are somewhere in the northern part of
  the state of Mississippi.”</p>
<p>“I know where we are,” drawled Irv Strong.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>“We’re in the woods.”</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to observe that you still have ‘lucid intervals,’ Irv,” said
  Ed Lowry. “But I have a rather more definite idea than that of our whereabouts.
  I studied it out on the map early this morning.”</p>
<p>“Good, good! Where are we?” cried out all the boys in a breath, and with
  great eagerness.</p>
<p>“Come here and see,” said Ed, unrolling his great river map. “You observe
  that a number of rivers originate in northern Mississippi and western Tennessee,
  almost under the levees of the Mississippi. There are the Big Sunflower,
  the Coldwater, and the Tallahatchie, with the Yalobusha only a little way
  off. All of them run into the Yazoo, which in its turn runs into the Mississippi
  near Vicksburg. All of them are marked on my map as navigable for a part
  of their course. All of them lie in a great flat basin or lowland swamp.
  But for the levees the Mississippi would flow into them whenever it rises
  to any considerable extent. In fact, they must originally have been mere
  bayous of the great river, running out of it and back into it again. The
  Mississippi levees have stopped all that ordinarily, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> the
  levees have given way this time, and so the Mississippi is now pouring
  its water into these rivers, and as there is too much of it for them to
  hold, it has filled the entire swamp country between them, making one vast
  stream of them all in effect. We are somewhere in between those rivers,
  and if we can keep our flatboat afloat and not wreck her among these trees,
  the current will sooner or later carry us into the natural channel of one
  or the other of them. That I understand to be Phil’s idea, and he is right.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Phil, who was restlessly pacing up and down the
  deck. “But has anybody any suggestion to make?”</p>
<p>Nobody had anything to offer.</p>
<p>“Very well, then,” said the young captain, “let’s get to work. We’ve talked
  enough. We must keep one fellow at a pump all the time. We can’t do much
  with the sweeps while we’re in the woods, and our greatest danger is that
  of running the boat into one of these big trees and wrecking her. To prevent
  that I want you, Irv, and you, Constant,—for you are the stoutest oarsmen,—to
  get into a skiff and carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> a
  line about a hundred feet in advance of the boat. She slews around pretty
  easily under a pull, and I want you two to guide her with a line. I’ll
  tell you when you are to row to right or left to avoid trees, and the rest
  of the time you’ve only to keep the line taut so as to be ready for emergencies.
  Get into the skiff at once, and take a light line with you.”</p>
<p>As soon as the skiff was in position and the guiding line stretched, Phil
  directed Will Moreraud to jump into another skiff and release the flatboat
  from her moorings.</p>
<p>It was perilous business navigating thus through a dense subtropical forest.
  Phil stood at the bow, intently watching and giving his commands in a restrained
  voice and with an apparent calm that sadly belied his actual condition
  of mind. Will and Ed “stood by” the sweeps, working the pumps, but holding
  themselves ready to pull on the great oars whenever Phil should find that
  mode of guiding the boat practicable.</p>
<p>Every now and then Phil would call to Irv and Constant in the skiff ahead,
  to pull with all their might to the right or left, and many times the flatboat,
  in spite of this diligence, had narrow escapes from disaster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>It was terribly hard work, and the mental strain of it which fell upon
  Phil was worse even than the tremendous physical exertion put forth by
  the other boys. There was no midday meal served that day, for it would
  have meant destruction for any one of the boys to leave his post of duty
  long enough even to prepare the simplest food.</p>
<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon Phil suddenly called to Irv:—</p>
<p>“Carry your line around a tree and check speed all you can!” Then turning
  to Will:—</p>
<p>“Jump into a skiff, Will, and take out another line, just as you did yesterday.
  When the boat stops, make fast!”</p>
<p>The boys obeyed promptly, and a few minutes later <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> was
  securely tied to two great trees—one in front and one astern.</p>
<p>Then Phil threw himself down on the deck and closed his eyes as if in
  sleep, and the boys in the skiffs came back on board.</p>
<p>The captain was manifestly exhausted. The strain of watching and directing
  the course of the boat through so many hours and under circumstances so
  difficult, the still greater strain put upon his mind by his consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> that
  he alone was responsible for the safety of boat and crew and cargo, and
  finally the sudden relief caused by a glimpse ahead which his comrades
  had been too busy to share, had brought on something very like collapse.</p>
<p>The boys said nothing, lest they disturb him. He lay still for a quarter
  of an hour perhaps. Then he got up, stripped off his clothing, and leaped
  overboard.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he returned to the deck refreshed by his bath, and
  almost himself again.</p>
<p>As he dried himself with a towel, he said:—</p>
<p>“Two of you go below and get supper. Make it a big one, for we are all
  starving. And get it as quickly as you can.” Then, after a brief pause,
  he added:—</p>
<p>“You didn’t notice it, I suppose, but we’re out of the woods!”</p>
<p>“How so?” asked Ed and Irv in unison.</p>
<p>“There’s an open river just ahead,” replied Phil. “Go forward and look.
  I’m going to sleep now. Wake me up when supper is ready.”</p>
<p>And in a moment the exhausted boy was sound asleep, stretched out upon
  a hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> plank,
  without pillow or other comfort of any kind.</p>
<p>“Poor fellow!” said Irv. “He’s got the big end of this job all the time.”</p>
<p>With that he dived below, and returning, placed a pillow under Phil’s
  bandaged head, and spread a blanket over him, for the air was chill.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THE CREW AND THEIR CAPTAIN</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Utterly</span> worn out as he was, it was not a part
  of Phil’s purpose—it was not in his nature, indeed—to neglect any duty.
  He ate a hearty supper with the boys, during which he talked very little.
  Once he said, suddenly:—</p>
<p>“I suspect it’s the Tallahatchie.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Why, the river we’ve reached. It lies to the left of our course. If it
  was the Sunflower, it would lie to the right. Anyhow, it runs into the
  Yazoo, and that’s all we ask of it.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Ed,” said Irv, “how long is the Yazoo?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” said Ed. “I’ll get the map after supper, and
  look.”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother,” said Phil. “The navigable part of it is one hundred and
  seventy-five miles long.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>“How did you come to know that?” asked Will. “I thought Ed was the geographer
  of this expedition.”</p>
<p>“So he is. But I’m captain, worse luck to it, and it’s my first business
  to know what lies ahead. So I looked this thing up on the map. The Yalobusha
  and Tallahatchie run together somewhere near a village called Greenwood,
  which is probably a hundred feet or so under water just now,—we may even
  float over the highest steeple in that interesting town, when we get to
  it,—and those two streams form the Yazoo. By the way, that little side
  issue of a river happens to be considerably longer, in its navigable part,
  than one of the most celebrated rivers in the world—the Hudson.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean it?” exclaimed Irv, for once surprised out of his drawl.</p>
<p>“Maybe I don’t. But I think I do. Ask Ed to study it out. I’m too tired
  to talk. I’m going to sleep for ten minutes now. Wake me up at the end
  of that time. Don’t fail!”</p>
<p>With that the exhausted boy rolled into a bunk, and in an instant was
  asleep again.</p>
<p>Ed got out his maps and studied them for a while.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>“He’s right, boys,” said the older one, after some measurements on the
  map.</p>
<p>“Of course he is,” said Constant. “He’s got into the habit of being right
  since we chose him to be ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>’ for this trip.
  But go on, Ed. Tell us about it.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ed, still scrutinizing the map, “the navigable part of the
  Hudson, from New York to Troy, is about one hundred and fifty-six miles
  long. The navigable part of the Yazoo is, as Phil said, one hundred and
  seventy-five miles long. Oh, by the way—”</p>
<p>“What is the thought behind that exclamation?” said Irv, when Ed paused;
  for Irv’s spirits were irrepressible.</p>
<p>“It just occurs to me,” said Ed, “that this wonderful river of ours, the
  Mississippi with its tributaries, is almost exactly one hundred times as
  long—in its navigable parts—as the greatest commercial river of the East.”</p>
<p>“In other words,” said Irv, “the East isn’t in it with us. Its great Hudson
  River would scarcely more than make a tail for the Mississippi below New
  Orleans. It would just about stretch from Cincinnati to Louisville. It
  would cover only a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> more
  than half the distance from St. Louis to Cairo, or from Cairo to Memphis.”</p>
<p>“True!” said Ed, “and pretty much the same thing is true of every great
  river in Europe. Not one of them would make a really important tributary
  of our wonderful river. All of them put together wouldn’t compare with
  the Ohio and its affluents.”</p>
<p>“Phil’s ten minutes are up,” said Will. “I hate to wake him, but that
  was his order.”</p>
<p>Phil had come, in this time of stress, to live mainly within himself.
  He was too much absorbed with his responsibilities to be able to put them
  aside, or even to treat them lightly.</p>
<p>“I’m ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’ and so I’m responsible,” he had
  said to Ed, “and I must think. Sometimes it doesn’t pay to talk, and sometimes
  I’m too tired to talk. I must just give orders without explaining them.
  You explain it all to the other fellows, and don’t let them misunderstand.
  I don’t like the job of commanding, even a little bit. But you fellows
  set me at it, and I accepted the responsibility. I’ll bear it to the end,
  but—”</p>
<p>“We all understand, Phil,” said Irv<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> Strong,
  who had joined the brothers. “Your crew was never better satisfied with
  its captain than it is to-day. But it will be still more loyal to-morrow
  and next day, and every other day till the voyage is ended.” Then in lighter
  vein—for Irv never liked to be serious for long at a time—he added: “Why,
  I wouldn’t even whisper if you told me not to, and you remember Mrs. Dupont
  posted me first, and you next, as irreclaimable whisperers.”</p>
<p>But to return to the night in question. When Phil was waked he took a
  lantern and made a minute inspection of the boat, inside and outside. Then
  he dropped into a skiff and rowed away to examine the moorings critically.
  On his return he said to his comrades:—</p>
<p>“The boat is leaking a good deal more than I like. The strain she received
  back there, yesterday or the day before, or a thousand years ago—I’m sure
  I don’t remember when it was—is beginning to tell upon her. One pump is
  no longer quite enough to keep the water in the bilge. We must keep both
  going—not quite all the time, of course, and not very violently, but pretty
  steadily. So that’s the order for to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> Two
  fellows on watch all the time, and both pumps to be kept going most of
  the time. I’ll sleep till two o’clock. Then wake me, and I’ll take my turn
  at a pump.”</p>
<p>The boys would have liked to exempt him from that duty. But his tone did
  not invite question or protest of any kind. It did not admit even of argument.
  It was a command—and Phil was commander.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A STRUGGLE IN THE DARK</p>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Phil was up long before the hour appointed.
  It was not yet midnight when he got out of his bunk to get a drink of water.
  As he did so he stepped into water half way up to his knees.</p>
<p>He instantly aroused his companions.</p>
<p>“The boat is sinking,” was his explanation. “Get to the pumps quick.”</p>
<p>Then lighting a lantern he made a thorough search of the hold in the hope
  of finding and stopping the leaks, but it was without avail.</p>
<p>With two boys at each pump the water could be kept down. That fact was
  established by an hour’s hard work.</p>
<p>“But we can’t keep up that sort of thing,” said Phil. “We must stop the
  leaks or abandon the boat.”</p>
<p>He thought for a while. Then he said to Ed:—</p>
<p>“Get some ropes, Ed, and make them fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> to
  the four corners of the tarpaulin. Bring each pair together about twenty
  feet away from the rag, and fasten them to another rope.”</p>
<p>“What’s your plan?” asked Irv, who was diligently pumping.</p>
<p>“I’m going to stretch the tarpaulin under the boat. Sailors stretch a
  sail that way sometimes to stop a leak.”</p>
<p>But this was much more easily said than done. When the tarpaulin was ready,
  Phil took all hands away from the pumps and, sending them to the skiffs,
  made an effort to force the great stiff cloth under the bow. It was a complete
  failure. The current was much too strong.</p>
<p>Then he went to the stern, where he hoped that the current would be of
  assistance. But that attempt also failed. The current doubled up the tarpaulin
  against the end of the boat, and it refused to slip under. The effort was
  several times repeated, but always with the same result—failure.</p>
<p>Finally Phil ordered all hands back to the flatboat. He went below and
  presently returned with a ball of twine. Unwinding its entire length and
  carefully coiling it on deck, he told Ed to fasten its farther end to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> one
  of the ropes attached to the tarpaulin strings.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, Phil?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to put my swimming to some practical account. Two of you fellows
  get into a skiff,—yes, three of you,—and lie off the larboard side of the
  boat.”</p>
<p>As they obeyed, the boy removed his clothes and tied the twine securely
  around his person.</p>
<p>“Watch the coil, Ed,” he said to his brother, “and don’t let it foul.
  Give me free string from the moment I go overboard. A very little pull
  would drown me!”</p>
<p>Then, taking a lantern, Phil scanned the water on both sides of the boat
  carefully for drift that might be in the way. When all was ready he leaped
  overboard, and after an anxious wait on the part of the boys he came to
  the surface again on the other side of the boat. He had repeated his old
  feat of diving under the flatboat, but this time it was harder than ever
  before. The strong current helped him a little, for the flatboat, tied
  bow and stern, lay almost athwart it. But a deal of difficulty was created
  by the necessity of dragging the twine after him. Ed saw to it that no
  tangle should occur,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> but
  the string dragged upon the deck and over the side and again upon the bottom
  of the boat, so that a much longer time and far more exertion was necessary
  for the dive than had ever been required before. Indeed, when Phil came
  up he was barely clear of the gunwale and his ability to hold his breath
  was completely at an end. A second more and he must have inhaled water
  and drowned. He was for the moment too much exhausted to climb into the
  skiff that was waiting for him, or even to give directions to his companions.</p>
<p>Seeing his condition, Irv and Will leaped overboard with their clothes
  on, and actually lifted the boy into the skiff, pushing him over its side
  as if he had been a log or a limp sack of meal.</p>
<p>As soon as he was able to gasp he helped his comrades into the little
  boat, and called out:—</p>
<p>“Pull away on the string, boys, as fast as you can, otherwise the current
  will carry it out from under the boat, at one end or the other.”</p>
<p>They obeyed promptly and presently had the end of the rope in their grasp.
  Pulling upon this, they succeeded in getting the edge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> of
  the tarpaulin under the starboard side of the flatboat. But there the thing
  stuck, and their tugging at the rope only resulted in drawing their skiff
  up to the flatboat’s side. Phil quickly saw that “pulling without a purchase”
  was futile. He called out:—</p>
<p>“Row to that tree yonder, and we’ll make fast to it.”</p>
<p>When that was done the pulling was resumed, this time “with a purchase.”
  But it was of no avail. The tarpaulin was drawn halfway under the boat,
  but there it stuck.</p>
<p>After a little Phil evolved a new idea. Releasing the skiff, he rowed
  to the flatboat and directed Irv to go aboard. Then returning to his former
  position, he again made the skiff fast to the tree.</p>
<p>“Now, Irv,” he called out, “you and Ed go below and bring up two or three
  barrels of flour.”</p>
<p>“What for?” asked Ed.</p>
<p>“Never mind what for. Do it quick,” was the answer.</p>
<p>When the barrels of flour were on deck, Phil said:—</p>
<p>“Find the middle of the tarpaulin as nearly as you can, and roll a barrel
  of flour overboard into it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>The thing was quickly done. The weight of the barrel of flour caused the
  tarpaulin to sink below the flatboat’s bottom, and it became possible to
  drag it under her for a further space.</p>
<p>“Roll another barrel overboard,” said the captain, when the tarpaulin
  refused to come farther. This enabled the boys to drag the sheet still
  farther, and finally, with the aid of a third barrel, they brought its
  edge ten feet beyond the gunwale.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Phil, “we’ve got to spill those flour barrels out of the cloth,
  or it won’t come up to the boat’s bottom and stop the leaks.”</p>
<p>How to do this was a puzzle. After studying the problem for a while, Phil
  directed Ed and Irv on board the flatboat, and Will and Constant in the
  skiff, to relax the tension on the great square of sailcloth.</p>
<p>“I’m going down on top of it,” he said, “to push the barrels off.”</p>
<p>“But when you do that, it’ll close up to the bottom of the boat and catch
  you in it,” said Will. “Don’t think of doing that!”</p>
<p>“I must,” said Phil, “we’re sinking; it’s our only chance, and I must
  take the risk. Let me have your big knife, Constant.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p>“What are you going to do with it?” asked the boy, as he handed it to
  Phil.</p>
<p>“Cut my way out if I can, or perhaps cut a way out for the flour barrels.
  Good-by, boys, if I never get back. And thank you for everything.”</p>
<p>With that he stepped upon the tarpaulin and slid down it under the boat.
  Presently he came back, gasping and struggling.</p>
<p>“I got one barrel out,” he said. Then he waited awhile for breath, and
  went under again. This time he was gone so long that his comrades feared
  the worst, with almost no hope for a better result. But they could do nothing.
  Presently Phil came up, but so exhausted that he could only cling in a
  feeble way to the edge of the canvas. The boys dragged him into the skiff,
  and he lay upon its bottom for a time like one almost drowned, which indeed
  he was. When he had somewhat recovered, Irv called to him:—</p>
<p>“I’m going down next time, Phil. You shan’t brag that you’re a better
  water-rat than I am.”</p>
<p>“No, you mustn’t,” said the boy; “I’ve found out how to do the trick now.
  But I’ve lost your knife in the shuffle, Constant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> Cast
  the skiff loose and let’s go aboard for another.”</p>
<p>The boy was so exhausted that his companions simply forbade him to make
  another attempt.</p>
<p>“You shan’t go down again,” said Irv, “and that’s all there is about it.
  If you’ve found out how to do the trick, as you say, save my life by explaining
  it to me, for I’m going down, anyhow.”</p>
<p>The boy was too weak to insist. So he explained:—</p>
<p>“Don’t go down on top of the sheet as I did. Dive under it. Find the barrels,—they’re
  almost exactly in the middle,—and slit the tarpaulin under them so that
  they can drop through. Oh, let me do it, I’m all right now.”</p>
<p>But Irv was overboard with a big butcher knife in his grasp, and the skiff
  was again securely fastened to its tree.</p>
<p>Irv dived three times. On coming up for the third time, he said with his
  irrepressible vivacity, “One, two, three times and out! Third time’s the
  charm, you know. I beg to announce that there’s a big slit in the tarpaulin
  and that the two barrels of triple X family flour are calmly reposing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> the
  mud that underlies <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>.”</p>
<p>“Good!” said Phil. “But we must hurry.”</p>
<p>And he gave rapid orders for drawing up the canvas on each side of the
  flatboat. Then he secured some tackle blocks and carried ropes from the
  two ends of the tarpaulin to the anchor windlass, and set the boys to draw
  it as tight as possible.</p>
<p>Then he went below, and found the water almost up to the level of the
  gunwales. That is to say, the boat proper, the part that floated all the
  rest, was very nearly full of water. A few inches more and the craft would
  have gone down like an iron pot with a hole in it.</p>
<p>There was hurried and anxious work at the pumps. At the end of an hour
  the gauge below showed that the water in the hold had been reduced by an
  inch or two.</p>
<p>“This will never do,” said the young captain. “We can’t keep on pumping
  like demons day and night till we get to New Orleans. We simply must find
  the leaks and stop them. The tarpaulin helps very greatly, but it isn’t
  enough.”</p>
<p>“But how?” asked Ed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
<p>“First of all cast the flatboat loose and let her float,” said skipper
  Phil. “It’s daylight now.”</p>
<p>“What good will that do?” asked one.</p>
<p>“None, perhaps. Perhaps a great deal. It will put us into a river for
  one thing. We’re in about as bad a place for sinking as there could be.
  Maybe we shall float into a better one. Maybe we shall come to some place
  where the land is still out of water and let the boat sink where we can
  save part of the cargo. Maybe anything. Cast loose, while I study things
  below.”</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A HARD-WON VICTORY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span>’s further explorations below, which occupied
  perhaps half an hour, convinced him that the pumps, if worked to their
  utmost capacity, were capable of emptying the hold of water within three
  or four hours, possibly somewhat sooner, as the tarpaulin was doing its
  work better, now that the flatboat was cast loose. The current was no longer
  interfering, as the boat was now moving with the stream, and the weight
  of the craft was pressing it closer to the canvas beneath.</p>
<p>Phil realized that to keep the pumps at work to the full for so long a
  time would fearfully tax the crew’s strength, taxing it perhaps even beyond
  its capacity of endurance. But he saw no alternative. The water simply
  must be got out of the hold. Till that should be done there would be no
  possibility of finding and stopping the leaks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p>So going again on deck, he said to his comrades:—</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what, boys, we’ve got to work for all we’re worth now for
  the next two or three hours. We must get at the inside of the bottom of
  the boat and find these leaks. We can’t do that till we empty her of water,
  or get her pretty nearly empty.”</p>
<p>“But how in the world are we to get at the leaks under all our freight?”
  asked Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“We have got to move the freight,” said Phil.</p>
<p>“But where?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Phil, “we’ve got to throw part of it overboard, I suppose,
  in order to give us room. Then we’ve got to shift the rest of it little
  by little from one spot to another, exposing a part of the bottom each
  time. We must find every leak that we can, and stop every one that is capable
  of being stopped. It will take two or three hours to pump the water out,
  and, I suppose, it will take two or three days to get these leaks fully
  stopped. In the meantime, we are all going to be enormously tired, and
  of course—”</p>
<p>“And of course we’ll all be as cross as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> a
  sawbuck,” said Irv Strong; “tired people always are; what we’ve got to
  do is to look out and not quarrel.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well,” said Phil, “I will take care of that. I am as cross as two
  sawbucks already, but I haven’t quarrelled with anybody yet, and I don’t
  mean to. And I’ll keep the rest of you too busy to quarrel. We will postpone
  all that until we get to New Orleans—”</p>
<p>“If we ever do get to New Orleans,” said Ed.</p>
<p>“Ever get to New Orleans? Why, we have got to get to New Orleans. We have
  undertaken to do that job for the owners of this cargo, and we are going
  to do it, if we have to pump the Mississippi River three times through
  this boat in getting there. Our present task is to reduce the necessity
  for pumping as much as we can.”</p>
<p>Phil found by experiment that one boy at each pump was nearly as efficient
  as two, and as the work of pumping was exhausting, he decided to keep only
  two boys at it, one at each pump. Then, taking the other two with him,
  he went below and with buckets they began dipping water from the hold and
  pouring it overboard at the bow. In this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> way
  they added largely to the work of the pumps, and every fifteen minutes
  or so two of the boys handling buckets would go to the pumps, and the two
  tired fellows at the pumps would come below and work with buckets.</p>
<p>It was wearisome work, but there was at any rate the encouragement of
  success. By one o’clock in the afternoon the water in the hold was so far
  reduced that it was no longer possible to dip it up with buckets with any
  profit. So Phil stopped that part of the work, and decided to keep the
  boys on very short shifts at the pumps, leaving them to rest completely
  between their tours of duty. He let two of them work for ten minutes. Then
  another pair took their places for ten minutes. Then the fifth one of the
  party—for Phil did his “stint” like the rest—became one of the relief pair,
  thus giving one boy twenty minutes’ rest instead of ten. This extra rest
  came in its turn of course to each of the boys, so that each boy worked
  forty minutes—ten minutes at a time—and rested sixty minutes out of every
  one hundred minutes or every hour and two-thirds.</p>
<p>About five o’clock in the afternoon Phil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> made
  one of his frequent journeys of inspection in the hold. He came on deck
  with an encouraged look in his tired face.</p>
<p>“We’ve got the water pretty nearly all out now, boys. Our next job is
  to keep it out by stopping leaks. We’ll work one pump all the time. I think
  that will keep even with the leaks, or pretty nearly so. If we find the
  water gaining on us, we’ll set the other pump going for a while.”</p>
<p>“And what’s your plan for stopping leaks, Phil?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“First of all we’ll find the leaks,” said Phil. “Then we’ll do whatever
  we can to stop them.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, we know that,” said Irv, with a touch of irritation in his voice,
  “but you know I meant—”</p>
<p>“Come, Irv, no quarrelling!” said Will Moreraud. “You’re tired and cross,
  but so are the rest of us.”</p>
<p>“I own up, and beg pardon,” said Irv, regaining his good nature by an
  effort, but instantly. “Phil, may I take time for a cold plunge before
  you assign me to my next duty?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Phil. “And I’ll take one with you. Come, boys, we’ll
  all be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> better
  for the shock of a shockingly cold bath. Jump in, all of you!”</p>
<p>And they all did, for, to the surprise of every one, Ed leaped overboard
  with them and swam twice around the boat before coming out of the very
  cold water and into the still colder air.</p>
<p>“Ed’s getting well, Phil,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Phil, as he watched his brother rubbing himself down. “Two
  weeks ago he would have come out of that water shivering as if with an
  ague, and the color of a table-cloth. Now look at him! He’s as red as a
  boiled lobster, and he’s actually laughing as he rubs the skin off with
  that piece of sanded tarpaulin that he has mistaken for a Turkish towel.
  Here, Ed, take a towel, or would you rather have some sandpaper or a rasp?”</p>
<p>“Thanks, old fellow,” said Ed, who had of course heard all the remarks
  concerning himself, “but this cloth feels good. I believe I am getting
  better. I’ve quit ‘barking’ anyhow.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Irv. “You haven’t dared utter a cough since that morning
  when <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> tried to make the last of herself
  by quitting the river and coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> off
  on this little picnic in the Mississippi swamps.”</p>
<p>“If you young gentlemen have quite finished your discussion of past happenings,
  and are ready to give attention to present exigencies,” said Phil, in that
  mocking tone which he sometimes playfully adopted, “you’ll please put your
  clothes on and report for duty in the hold, where there’s some important
  work to be done. It’s your turn at the pump, Constant. Get thee to thy
  task, and don’t forget to remind me when your time’s up.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Phil, when they threw open the forward door of the flatboat
  to open a passage for taking out freight, “I suppose we ought to divide
  up the loss by throwing out about an equal quantity of each owner’s freight.
  But we can’t do it, so there’s an end of that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the law will take care of all that,” said Ed.</p>
<p>“The law? How?”</p>
<p>“Why the law requires everybody interested in the boat or the cargo to
  share the loss, when freight must be thrown overboard to save the ship.”</p>
<p>“But how can that be done?” asked Irv.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why, we must keep account of what we throw overboard. When we sell the
  rest at New Orleans, we shall know just what was the value of the part
  jettisoned,—that’s the law term for throwing things overboard, I believe,—and
  that loss must be divided among the owners of the boat herself, the owners
  of cargo on board, and the insurance companies, if any of the freight is
  insured. Each one’s share of the loss will be in precise proportion to
  his interest.”</p>
<p>“Illustrate,” said Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“Well,” rejoined Ed, “suppose we find the boat and her total cargo to
  be worth one thousand dollars—”</p>
<p>“Oh, rubbish! It’s worth many times that,” broke in Will. “Why, I should
  value—”</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” said the other. “I’m ‘supposing a case,’ as Irv says,
  and simply for convenience I take one thousand dollars as the total value
  of the boat and everything in her. Now, suppose we have to throw overboard
  one hundred dollars’ worth. That is one-tenth of the whole. That tenth
  must be divided, not equally, but proportionally, among all the persons
  interested. Suppose the boat is worth two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> dollars.
  That is one-fifth the total value, and so the boat owners must bear one-fifth
  of the one hundred dollars’ loss. That is to say, we fellows should have
  to ‘pony up’ twenty dollars among us, or four dollars apiece. A man owning
  three hundred dollars’ worth of freight would be charged thirty dollars,
  and so on through the list.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” said Phil, who in the meantime had been studying ways and
  means of accomplishing the practical purpose in hand. “And a very good
  arrangement it is. Now stop talking, and let’s heave out some of these
  bales of hay.”</p>
<p>“Why not take some of the other things instead?” asked Irv. “They are
  heavier, and to throw them over would lighten the boat more.”</p>
<p>All this while the boys were at work getting the hay out.</p>
<p>“We aren’t trying to lighten the boat,” replied Phil. “We’re only trying
  to make room, and the hay takes up more room, dollar’s worth for dollar’s
  worth, than anything else. So it’s cheapest to ‘jettison’ hay—thanks for
  that new word, Ed. Now, heave ho!” And the first bale of hay went over
  the bow into the water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>“Now, another!”</p>
<p>In a brief time a considerable space was cleared.</p>
<p>“That will do, I think,” said Phil. “We shan’t have to ‘jettison’ anything
  more, if you fellows will stop your chatter and get to work. If you don’t,
  I’ll jettison some of the crew.”</p>
<p>This brought a needed smile, for the boys were by this time almost exhausted
  with work and loss of sleep. Phil thought of this. He had not himself slept
  a moment since his discovery that the boat was sinking at midnight of the
  night before, while all the rest had caught refreshing little naps between
  their tours of duty at the pumps. But he left himself out of the account
  in laying his plans.</p>
<p>“See here, boys,” he said, “there isn’t room for more than one of you
  to work here with me at these leaks. One must stay at the pump on deck,
  of course, but the other two might as well go to sleep till we need you
  to move freight again.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I like that,” said Irv. “But why shouldn’t <i>you</i> do a little
  of the sleeping, instead of shoving it all off on us, as you’ve done all
  day?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, never mind about me. I shan’t sleep till we get things in shape,
  so you and Ed go to sleep. You go and relieve Constant at the pump, Will,
  and let him come and help me.”</p>
<p>“You said there was to be no quarrelling,” said Irv, “and I have thus
  far obeyed. I have even stood Ed’s exposition of the law about throwing
  freight overboard, without a murmur, but now I’m going to quarrel with
  the skipper of this craft, if he doesn’t consent to take his full and fair
  share of the sleeping that simply has to be done. He always takes his full
  share of the work, even to the cooking. It was only yesterday that he made
  the worst pot of coffee we’ve had yet. I insist that he shall not be permitted
  basely to shirk his fair share of the sleeping.”</p>
<p>The other boys echoed the kindly sentiment that Irv had put in that playful
  way, and Phil was touched by their consideration. Instinctively holding
  out his hands to them, he said:—</p>
<p>“Thank you, fellows. It’s awfully good of you. But I simply could not
  sleep now. I cannot close my eyes till I see this work of stopping leaks
  so well advanced as to be sure that the boat is safe. I promise you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> that
  just as soon as that is accomplished I’ll let you fellows go on with the
  work, and I’ll take even a double turn at sleeping.”</p>
<p>“You’ll promise that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And by way of compromise, and to keep you from quarrelling, Irv,
  I’ll let you postpone your first sleeping turn till you can get me something
  hot to swallow—a canned soup with an egg in it, or something else sustaining.
  I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>During the day’s excitements there had been no regular meals served on
  the boat, but as there happened to be a cold boiled ham in the larder and
  plenty of bread, the boys had indulged frequently in sandwiches. But it
  now occurred to them that Phil, in his anxiety, had quite forgotten to
  do this, and had, in fact, eaten nothing whatever for more than eighteen
  hours. So Irv hastened to prepare him some food of the kind he had asked
  for.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Phil and Constant, armed with hammers and nails, and
  bits of board which they from time to time sawed or cut to fit spaces,
  were busy at the leaks. When they had done all they could in that way within
  the space laid bare by the removal of the hay, they rolled other freight
  into that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> space,
  thus exposing another part of the bottom.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/tour.jpg" width="346" height="600" alt="" /><br />A TOUR OF INSPECTION.<br />
“‘Hello! Irv; we’ve found the crevasse at last.’”</p>
<p>In this way the work went forward during the night, all of the boys except
  Phil securing some sleep in brief snatches, and all of them ministering,
  so far as they were permitted, to their captain’s need for tempting food.</p>
<p>About daylight, in making a shift of freight, Phil suddenly came upon
  something that made him call out:—</p>
<p>“Hello! what’s this? I say, Irv,”—for Irving was then working with him,—“we’ve
  found the crevasse at last.”</p>
<p>“I should say so,” said Irv, with a slower drawl than usual, as he held
  up his lantern and looked. “The Mississippi River and all its large and
  interesting family of tributaries seem trying to come aboard here.”</p>
<p>Just where the gunwale joined the bottom planks of the boat a great seam
  had been wrenched open, and the water was actually spouting and spurting
  through it.</p>
<p>“There’s one consolation,” said Phil. “There isn’t any other leak like
  this anywhere.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Why, if there were two such, we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> have
  gone to Davy Jones’s locker long ago.”</p>
<p>Then the two boys set to work trying to fasten a board over the open seam,
  but their efforts failed completely. Their united strength was not sufficient
  even to press the board against the timbers, much less to hold it in place
  long enough to nail it there. For the whole weight of the boat and cargo
  was pressing down into the river and forcing this jet of water upward through
  the opening.</p>
<p>“Call the entire crew, Irv,” said Phil. “We shall need them all for this
  job—including the fellow at the pump.”</p>
<p>Then, while Irv went to summon the boys, Phil secured a piece of plank
  three inches thick, very green and very heavy, which had been purchased
  at Vevay to serve as a staging over which to roll freight in taking it
  on or discharging it.</p>
<p>“Get me the brace and bit, Will—the quarter-inch auger bit. And, Ed, see
  if you can find the spikes that were left over in building the boat. Bring
  the heaviest hammers we’ve got too, some of you.”</p>
<p>All this while the boy was measuring, calculating, sawing, and hewing
  with an axe to fit his great plank to its place. He bored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> holes
  in it at intervals, to facilitate the driving of spikes through its tough
  and tenacious thickness.</p>
<p>When all was ready, the boys made a strenuous effort to force the timber
  down against the crack, but to no purpose. Their strength and weight were
  not sufficient.</p>
<p>Presently a happy thought struck Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” he said, and with that he rolled several barrels of corn
  meal into the open space.</p>
<p>“Now,” he cried, “three of you stand on one end of the plank while I drive
  it into place. Let the other end ride free of the bottom, but one of you
  hold it so that it can’t slew away from the gunwale.”</p>
<p>The boys did this, and Will succeeded in driving one end of the timber
  into place while three of his comrades stood upon that end of it. The other
  end was held up by the waterspout a foot from the bottom of the boat, but
  Ed was holding it against the gunwale, in the place where it was desired
  to force it down.</p>
<p>“Now, hold it so,” said Will, “and I’ll force it down.”</p>
<p>With that he turned a two-hundred-pound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> barrel
  of meal on end upon the plank just beyond the point where the three boys
  were standing. This pressed the timber down somewhat, and Will helped it
  with another barrel. Then he began bringing heavy sacks of corn and oats,
  so heavy that he could scarcely handle them. These he piled high on top
  of the meal barrels, and the combined weight forced the plank down to within
  an inch of the bottom.</p>
<p>With one end securely weighted down, he began piling freight in the same
  way upon the other. Now and then the resisting water would push the heavy
  and heavily weighted plank away from the gunwale and force a passage for
  itself between. But when the plank was securely weighted down upon the
  bottom, two or three of the boys, acting together, were able, with axes
  and heavy hammers, to drive it finally and firmly against the side of the
  boat.</p>
<p>Then with the long wrought-iron spikes it was firmly secured in its place,
  but Phil decided not to remove any of the freight that was piled on top
  of it, lest the tremendous water pressure from below should force even
  the great iron spikes out of their sockets and set the leak going again.
  Indeed, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> this
  he directed his comrades to pile all the freight they could so that its
  weight should fall upon the protecting timber.</p>
<p>By the time that all this was done it was eleven o’clock in the morning,
  and Irv Strong turned to Phil with an earnest look in his eyes, and said:—</p>
<p>“We claim the fulfilment of your promise, Phil. You must go to sleep now.”</p>
<p>The other boys stood by Irv’s side with faces as earnest as his own. It
  was obvious that he spoke for all of them and as the result of an understanding.
  Phil hesitated for a moment. Then he said:—</p>
<p>“Thank you, fellows, all of you. I’ll do as you say.”</p>
<p>As he almost staggered toward the cabin in his exhaustion, he paused,
  still thoughtful of the general welfare, and said:—</p>
<p>“Irv, you take charge while I sleep, and call me if anything happens.”</p>
<p>Two minutes later the lad was deeply slumbering.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">RESCUE</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Phil at last waked, Ed was putting supper
  on the table, and it was rather a late supper too, for the boys had purposely
  postponed it in order to let Phil get all the sleep possible. He had in
  fact slept for fully eight hours.</p>
<p>“Well, how do you feel now, skipper?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly,” answered the boy, yawning and stretching. “Stupid
  for the most part, hungry for the rest of it. I say, what time of day or
  night is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s about eight thirty <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,” answered Constant,
  pulling out his antique Swiss watch and consulting it.</p>
<p>“Yes, but <i>what</i> <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>? What day is it?
  When did I go to sleep?”</p>
<p>The boys soon straightened things out in their captain’s temporarily bewildered
  mind. The effort to do so was aided by the sight and smell of a great platter
  which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> Ed
  at that moment set upon the table. It held a “boiled dinner.” There was
  a juicy brisket of corned beef on top. Under it were peeled and boiled
  potatoes, boiled turnips still retaining their shape, and beneath all was
  the last cabbage on board, the remains of a purchase made at Memphis a
  week or ten days before, though to the boys it seemed many moons past.</p>
<p>As Phil eyed the savory dish he became for the first time fully awake.</p>
<p>“I say, fellows,” he broke out, “what does this mean? Why didn’t you have
  this sort of thing for dinner instead of keeping it for supper?”</p>
<p>“Because you weren’t awake at dinner time to help us eat it, Phil. It’s
  the last really good meal we’re likely to see for days to come, and we—”</p>
<p>“You see,” broke in Irv Strong, “we’re bound to build you up again, Phil,
  if we have to do it with a hammer and nails. But how recklessly you expose
  your country breeding!” as he helped all round; “if you were captain of
  an ocean liner now instead of a flatboat, you would know that dinner before
  six o’clock is impossible to civilized man, and that the actual dinner
  hour in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> those
  regions where dress coats and culture prevail, ranges from seven to eight
  o’clock.”</p>
<p>“You are unjust in your mockery, Irv,” said Ed. “And by that you in your
  turn simply expose your provincialism—and ours, too.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked Irv, chuckling to think that he had succeeded in diverting
  the conversation from channels in which it might easily have become emotional.
  For all the boys had been for hours under a strain of severe anxiety on
  Phil’s account. They were full of admiration for the self-sacrificing way
  in which he had worked and thought and planned for the common welfare.
  They had been touched to the heart by his exhaustion after his strenuous
  work was done, and they had been anxious all that afternoon, lest the breakdown
  of his strength should prove to be lasting. His appetite at supper relieved
  that fear, but the very relief made them all the more disposed to be a
  trifle tender toward him. Irv had prevented a scene, so he didn’t mind
  Ed’s criticism.</p>
<p>“How’s that, Ed?”</p>
<p>“Why, when you sneer at people because their customs are different from
  those that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> we
  are used to, don’t you see you are just as narrow-minded as they are when
  they sneer at us because our customs are not theirs.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to sneer,” said Irv. “But, of course, it does seem
  odd for people to eat dinner at six or seven o’clock in the evening, instead
  of eating it about noon.”</p>
<p>“Not a bit of it. The dinner hour is a matter of convenience. In a little
  town like ours it is convenient for everybody to go home to dinner at noon,
  and so everybody does it. In a big city where people live five or ten miles
  away from their places of business, it is impossible. In such cities business
  doesn’t begin till nine or ten o’clock in the morning, when the banks and
  exchanges open, and it is in every way handier to have dinner after the
  day’s work is done. Our habits are just as odd to city people as theirs
  are to us.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I see that,” said Irv, “and ‘Farmer Hayseed’ is just as snobbish
  when he laughs at ‘them city folks’ as the city people are when they ridicule
  him. It reminds me of the nursery story about the town mouse and the country
  mouse.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>“How about the leaks, fellows?” asked Phil, who was now quite himself
  again.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any to speak of,” reported Irv. “We’ve gone over the whole
  bottom of the boat now, stopping every little crack, and now she’s as dry
  as a bone. Five minutes’ pumping in an hour is quite enough.”</p>
<p>“All right!” said the captain. “Then we’ll take off her bandages in the
  morning. With that tarpaulin wrapped around her she looks like Sally Hopper
  when she comes to school with a toothache and a swelled jaw bound up in
  flannel.”</p>
<p>But the next morning brought with it some other and more pressing work
  than that of removing the tarpaulin.</p>
<p>At daylight the boat was floating easily and rapidly down the middle of
  the overflowed river, when Phil, who was on deck, saw half a mile ahead,
  a group of people huddled together upon a small patch of ground that protruded
  above the water. It was, in fact, the top of one of those very high Indian
  mounds that abound in the Sunflower swamp country.</p>
<p>Calling the other boys on deck, Phil took a skiff and rowed ahead as rapidly
  as he could. When he reached the little patch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> of
  dry land, which was circular in shape, and did not exceed twenty feet in
  diameter, he found a family of people in a woful state of destitution and
  wretchedness.</p>
<p>They had no fire and no fuel. They had been for several days without food
  and were now so weak that they could scarcely speak above a whisper. The
  party consisted of a father, a mother, three big-eyed children, and a negro
  man.</p>
<p>The negro man, great stalwart fellow that he was, was now the most exhausted
  one of the party, while the youngest of the children, whom the others called
  “Baby,” as if she were yet too small to carry a name of her own, was still
  chipper and full of interest in the strange things about her when she was
  taken on board the flatboat.</p>
<p>The work of rescue occupied a considerable time and cost the boys some
  very hard work. The people on the mound were too feeble from hunger and
  long exposure even to help in their own deliverance. The negro man had
  to be lifted bodily into a skiff and laid out at full length upon its bottom.
  The rest, except “Baby” were not in much better condition. The man could
  walk indeed, in an unsteady way, but he was so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> dazed
  in his mind that it required force to keep him from dropping out of the
  skiff on the way to the flatboat.</p>
<p>The woman and the two older children were chewing strips of leather, cut
  from the man’s boot tops. The baby continually sucked its thumb.</p>
<p>People in such condition are very difficult to manage. They are physically
  incapable of doing anything to help themselves, and mentally just alert
  enough to interfere querulously with the efforts of others to help them.
  To get such a company into frail, unsteady skiffs, to row them away to
  the flatboat, and then to “hoist them aboard,” as Phil called the operation,
  required quite two hours of very hard work, but it was accomplished at
  last.</p>
<p>But to get them aboard was only the beginning of the work of rescue. They
  were starving and they must be fed. Phil was for setting out the remainder
  of the last evening’s boiled dinner at once and bidding them help themselves.
  But Irv’s superior knowledge of such matters prevented that disastrous
  blunder.</p>
<p>“Why, don’t you know, Phil, that to give them even an ounce of solid food
  now would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> be
  to kill them! Open a can of consomme, and heat it quick.”</p>
<p>When the soup was ready he peppered it lavishly, explaining to Ed:—</p>
<p>“The problem is not merely to get food into their stomachs, but to get
  their stomachs to turn the food to some account after we’ve got it there.
  In their weakened condition they can’t digest anything solid, and it is
  a serious question whether their stomachs can even manage this thin, watery
  soup. So I’m putting pepper into it as a ‘bracer.’ It will stimulate their
  stomachs to do their work.”</p>
<p>As he explained, he fed the soup to the sufferers—a single spoonful to
  each. They were clamorous for more, but Irv was resolute.</p>
<p>“Wait till I see how that goes,” he said. “You can’t have any more till
  I say the word.”</p>
<p>The children cried. The woman hysterically laughed and cried alternately.
  The man sat still with bowed head and with the tears trickling down his
  face—whether tears of joy, of distress, or of mere weakness, it was hard
  to say.</p>
<p>The negro man was too far gone even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> to
  swallow. Irv had to turn him on his back and literally pour a spoonful
  of soup down his throat. Then he said to Ed and Constant:—</p>
<p>“I’m afraid this man is dying. His hands are very cold and so are his
  feet—cold to the knees. Take some towels—no, here,” seizing a blanket from
  one of the bunks,—“take this. Dip it into boiling water,—fortunately we’ve
  got it ready,—wring the blanket out and wrap his feet and legs in it, from
  the knees down. Then take towels and do the same for his hands. Pound him,
  too, punch him, roll him about—bulldoze and kuklux him in every way you
  can till you get his blood to going again! It’s the only way to save the
  poor fellow’s life.”</p>
<p>By this time Irv deemed it safe to give each of his other patients another
  spoonful or two of the soup, and he even ventured to pour three more spoonfuls
  down the throat of the negro.</p>
<p>“He’s reviving a little,” Irv explained. “And as a strong man, with a
  robust stomach accustomed to coarse food, he can stand more soup than the
  others.”</p>
<p>Thus little by little Irv and Ed, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> such
  assistance from the other boys as they needed, slowly brought the starving
  party back to life. As the negro man had been the first to succumb to starvation,—perhaps
  because his robust physical nature demanded more food than more delicately
  constructed bodies do,—so he was the first to recover. By nightfall he
  was walking about on the deck, while all the rest were still lying in the
  bunks below as invalids.</p>
<p>After awhile Irv stopped him.</p>
<p>“Did anybody ever tell you that you’re an exceptional personage?”</p>
<p>“Lor’ no, boss. Well, yes, some o’ de black folks in de chu’ch done took
  ’ceptions to me sometimes ’cause I wouldn’t give enough to de cause, but
  fore de court, boss—”</p>
<p>“That isn’t what I mean,” broke in Irv, with smiles rippling all over
  him, and running down even to his legs. “I mean, did anybody ever notice
  that you were,—oh, well, never mind that; but tell me, would you like a
  good big slice of cold corned beef before you go to sleep?”</p>
<p>The negro answered in words. But his more emphatic answer was not one
  of words. He threw his arms around Irv in a gian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>t’s
  embrace that almost crushed the youth’s bones.</p>
<p>“There, that will do,” said Irv. “You have an engagement as a cotton compress
  or something of that sort, when you’re at home, I suppose. But now, if
  I let you have a good big slice of cold corned beef to-night, will you
  eat it just as I tell you, take a bite when I tell you and at no other
  time, and stop whenever I tell you? Will you promise?”</p>
<p>“Shuah, sar, shuah,” eagerly responded the man.</p>
<p>“But ‘sure’ isn’t enough,” replied Irv, half in amusement and half in
  seriousness, for he felt that his experiment was very risky, and he wanted
  to be able to regulate it, and stop it at any point. “Sure isn’t enough.
  Will you promise me on the isosceles triangle?”</p>
<p>“Yes, boss.”</p>
<p>“On the grand panjandrum?”</p>
<p>“For shuah.”</p>
<p>“And even on the parallelopipedon itself?”</p>
<p>“Shuah, boss. I dunno what dem names mean, but for shuah I’ll do jes’
  what you tells me to if you’ll lem’ me have de meat.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>Irv was satisfied. He went below and prepared a sandwich. Returning, he
  allowed the man to eat it in bites, with long intervals between. It not
  only did no harm, it restored the man to such vitality that Phil decided
  to get some information out of him as to the flatboat’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>He learned first that the rescued family sleeping below was that of a
  well-to-do planter; that the flood, coming as it did as the result of a
  crevasse, and therefore suddenly, had taken them completely by surprise,
  in the middle of the night, four or five days ago; that they had with difficulty
  escaped to the Indian mound in a field near by, and that they had not been
  able to take with them any food, or anything else except the clothes they
  had on. This accounted for the fact that the woman wore only a wrapper
  over her nightdress, that the man was nearly naked, and that the children
  were clad only in their thin little nightgowns.</p>
<p>Then Phil learned that <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> was now in the
  Tallahatchie River, as he had guessed, not far from the point where it
  enters the Yazoo, at Greenwood. A little study of the map showed Phil that
  if this were true, he might expect to reach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> Vicksburg
  within four or five days, which in fact is what happened, not on the fourth
  or fifth, but on the sixth day thereafter, early in the morning.</p>
<p>In the mean time the crew and their guests had eaten up pretty nearly
  all the boat’s store of provisions, and <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> had
  been stripped of her unsightly swaddling-cloth, the tarpaulin. Phil tied
  her up at the landing near the historic town as proudly as if she had not
  run away, and misbehaved as she had done.</p>
<p>“She has only been showing us some of the wonders of the Wonderful River,
  that we should never otherwise have known anything about,” he said.</p>
<p>But this is going far ahead of my story. The boys and their boat were
  still in the Yazoo, nearly a week’s journey above Vicksburg. So let us
  return to them.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A YAZOO AFTERNOON</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were no difficulties of any consequence
  to contend with after <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> entered the Yazoo.
  The boys’ guests were well now, and joined them in their long talks on
  deck. These talks covered every conceivable subject, and the planter, who
  proved himself to be an unusually well-informed man, added not a little
  to their interest.</p>
<p>“I say, Ed,” said Phil one day, holding up one of his newspapers, “you
  were all wrong about the crops.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean, Phil?”</p>
<p>“Why, you put corn first, as the most valuable crop produced in this country.”</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not if this newspaper writer knows his business and tells the truth.”</p>
<p>“Why, what does he say?” asked Ed, with an interest he had not at first
  shown in Phil’s criticism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
<p>“He says that in Missouri, which I take to be one of the great corn-growing
  states—”</p>
<p>“It is all that,” answered Ed. “What about it?”</p>
<p>“Why, he says that in Missouri the eggs and spring chickens produced by
  what he calls ‘the great American hen’ sell every year for more money than
  all the corn, wheat, oats, and hay raised in the state, twice over. And
  he gives the figures for it too.”</p>
<p>“That is surprising,” said Ed, “but it is very probably true. The trouble
  is that we have no trustworthy statistics on the subject. No ordinary farmer
  keeps any account of his crops of that kind. Not one farmer in a hundred
  could tell you at the end of a year how many dozens of eggs or how many
  pairs of chickens he had sold. Still less could he tell you how many of
  either his family had eaten. So it must all be guess-work about such crops,
  while practically every bushel of wheat, corn, and oats and every bale
  of cotton or hay, and every pound of tobacco is carefully set down in official
  records.”</p>
<p>“That reminds me,” said Irv, “of the remark a farmer once made to me,
  when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> deploring
  the poverty of himself and his class.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Why, he said that lots of men in the cities got two or three thousand
  dollars a year for their work, while he never yet had got over five hundred
  dollars for his. I questioned him a little, and found that he didn’t take
  any account of his house rent and fuel free, or of all the farm produce
  that his family ate. He thought the few hundred dollars he had to the good
  at the end of the year, after paying for his groceries and dry goods, was
  all he got for his labor.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of these unconsidered crops,” said the planter, “I fancy it
  would astonish us if we could have the figures on them. It is said, for
  example, that more than a million turkeys are eaten in New York City alone
  every winter. Now, if we count all the other great cities and all the little
  ones, and all the towns and all the country homes where turkeys are eaten,
  it will be very hard to guess how many millions of these fowls are raised
  and sold and eaten in this country every year.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard on the turkeys,” moralized Will Moreraud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” answered Phil. “I remember reading a story by James
  K. Paulding called ‘A Reverie in the Woods.’ He tells how he fell half
  asleep and heard all the animals and birds and fishes holding a sort of
  congress to denounce man for his cruelties to them. After a while the earthworm
  got so excited over the matter that he wriggled himself into the brook.
  Thereupon the trout, who had also been one of the complainants against
  man’s cruelty, snapped up the worm, and swallowed him. Seeing this, the
  cat grabbed the trout, and the fox caught the cat, and the eagle caught
  the fox, and the hawk made luncheon on the dove, and so on through the
  whole list. I imagine that that is nature’s way. Everything that lives,
  lives at the expense of something else that lives. It is all a struggle
  for existence, with the survival of the fittest as the outcome. And as
  a man, or even a commonplace boy like me, is fitter to live than a turkey,
  I think the slaughter of those innocents is all right enough.”</p>
<p>“You are entirely right, Phil,” said Ed. “A pound of boy is certainly
  worth fifty or fifty thousand pounds of turkey, because one boy can do
  more for the world than all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> the
  turkeys that were ever hatched. And when a boy eats turkey he converts
  it into boy, and it helps him to grow into a man.”</p>
<p>“Precisely!” said Irv Strong. “It cost the worthless lives of many pigs,
  turkeys, chickens, sheep, and cattle to make George Washington. But surely
  one George Washington was worth more than all the pigs, turkeys, chickens,
  sheep, and beef-cattle that were killed in all this country between the
  day he was born and the day of his death. But pardon us,” added Irv, turning
  to the planter, “you were going to say something more when we interrupted.”</p>
<p>“It was nothing of any consequence,” answered their guest, “and your little
  discussion has interested me more than anything I had thought of saying.
  But I was going to say that according to a New York newspaper’s careful
  calculation, that city pays more than a million dollars every spring for
  white flowers for Easter decorations alone, while its expenditures for
  flowers during the rest of the year is estimated at not less than five
  millions more. Then there is the peanut crop. Who ever thinks of it? Who
  thinks of peanuts in any serious way? Yet it was the peanut crop that saved
  the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> of
  tidewater Virginia and North Carolina from actual starvation during the
  first few years after the Civil War. And every year that crop amounts to
  more than two and a half million bushels!”</p>
<p>“What luck for the circuses!” exclaimed Will Moreraud.</p>
<p>“But the circuses do not furnish the chief market for peanuts,” said Irv,
  who was somewhat “up” on these things.</p>
<p>“Where are they consumed, then?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Well, the greater part of them are used in the manufacture of ‘pure’
  Italian or French olive oil—most of it ‘warranted sublime,’” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Are we a nation of swindlers, then?” asked Phil, whose courage was always
  offended by any suggestion of untruth or hypocrisy or dishonesty.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Irv, “how to draw the line there. The men who make
  olive oil out of peanuts stoutly contend that their olive oil is really
  better, more wholesome, and more palatable than that made from olives.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t they call it peanut oil, then, and advertise it as better than
  olive oil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> and
  take the consequences?” asked upright, downright, bravely honest Phil.</p>
<p>“Men in trade are not always so scrupulous about honesty and truthfulness
  as you are, Phil,” said Ed. “But sometimes—they excuse their falsehoods
  on the ground—”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any excuse possible for not telling the truth,” said Phil.
  “Men who tell lies in their business are swindlers, and that’s the end
  of the matter. If they are making a better article than the imported one,
  they ought to say so, and people would find it out quickly enough. When
  they offer their goods as something quite different from what they really
  are, they are telling lies, I say, and I, for one, have no respect for
  a liar.”</p>
<p>“You are right, Phil, of course,” said Ed. “But there is a world of that
  sort of thing done. The potteries in New Jersey, I am told, mark their
  finer wares with European brands, and they contend that if they did not
  do it they could not sell their goods.”</p>
<p>“A more interesting illustration,” said the planter, “is found in the
  matter of cheeses. Cheese, as at first produced, is the same the world
  over. But cheese that is set to ‘ripen’ in the caves of Roquefort is one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> thing,
  cheese ripened at Camembert is another, and so on through the list. Now
  of late years it has been discovered that the differences between these
  several kinds of cheese are due solely to microbes. There is one sort of
  microbe at Roquefort, another at Brie, and so on. Now American cheesemakers
  found this out some years ago, and decided that they could make any sort
  of cheese they pleased in this country. So they took the several kinds
  of imported cheeses, selected the best samples of each, and set to work
  to cultivate their microbes. By introducing the microbes of Roquefort into
  their cheeses they made Roquefort cheeses of them. By inoculating them
  with the Brie microbe, or the Camembert microbe, or the Stilton or Gruyère
  microbe, they converted their simple American cheeses into all these choice
  varieties. And it is asserted by experts that these American imitations,
  or some of them at any rate, are actually superior to the imported cheeses,
  besides being much more uniform in quality.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Phil. “But why not tell the truth about it? Surely,
  if their cheeses are better than those made abroad, they can trust the
  good judges of cheese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> to
  find out the fact and declare it. And when that fact became known they
  could sell their cheese for a higher price than that of the imported article,
  on the simple ground of its superiority. How I do hate shams and frauds
  and lies—and especially liars!”</p>
<p>“What bothers me,” drawled Irv, “is that I’ve been eating microbes all
  my life without knowing it. I here and now register a solemn vow that I’ll
  never again eat a piece of cheese—unless I want to.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the microbes are all right,” said Ed, “provided they are of the right
  sort. There are some microbes that kill us, and others that we couldn’t
  live without. There are still others, like those in cheese, that do us
  neither good nor harm, except that they make our food more palatable. For
  that matter the yeast germ is a microbe, and it is that alone that makes
  our bread light. Surely we can’t quit eating light bread and take to heavy
  baked dough instead, because light bread is made light by the presence
  of some hundreds of millions of living germs in every loaf of it while
  it is in the dough state.”</p>
<p>“Coming back to the question of crops,” said the planter, “does it occur
  to you that there would be no possibility of prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> in
  this country but for the absolute freedom of traffic between the states?”</p>
<p>“Would you kindly explain?” said Ed.</p>
<p>“Certainly. The farmers of New York and New Jersey used to grow all the
  wheat, and all the beef, mutton, and pork that were eaten in the great
  city, and they made a good living by doing it. But the time came when the
  western states could raise wheat and beef and all the rest of it much more
  cheaply than any eastern farmer could. This threatened to drive the New
  York and New Jersey farmers out of business, and naturally, if they could,
  they would have made their legislators pass laws to exclude this western
  wheat and meat from competition with their crops. This would have hurt
  the western farmer; for what would in that case have happened in New York
  would have happened in all the other eastern states. But it would have
  hurt the people of the great cities—and indeed all the people in the country
  still more. It would have made the city people’s food cost them two or
  three times as much as before. That would have compelled them to charge
  more for their manufactured products and for their work in carrying on
  the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> commerce
  of the country. That would have crippled commerce,—which lives upon exceedingly
  small margins of profit,—and the prosperity of the country would have been
  ruined. It was to prevent that sort of thing that our national government
  was formed, with a constitution which forbade any state to interfere with
  commerce between the states.”</p>
<p>“What became of the New York farmer, then?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“When he found that he couldn’t raise wheat, corn, etc., as cheaply as
  the western farmer could sell them in New York, he quit raising those things
  and produced things that paid him instead.”</p>
<p>“What sort of things?”</p>
<p>“Fruits, poultry, milk, butter, eggs, cheese, vegetables, buckwheat, honey,
  etc., and in producing these the New York farmer grew richer than ever.
  Since New York quit raising on any considerable scale the things that we
  commonly think of as farm products, that state has become the richest in
  the country in the value of its agricultural production, simply because
  the New York farmer raises only those things for which there is a market
  almost at his front gate.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>
<p>“That is very interesting,” said Will. “But how is it that the far West
  can furnish New York and Philadelphia and the rest of the eastern cities
  with bread and meat cheaper than the farmers near those cities can sell
  the same things?”</p>
<p>“The value of land,” said the planter, “has much to do with it. The value
  of a farmer’s land is his investment, and first of all, he must earn interest
  on that.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” said Ed, “but that, it seems to me, is a very small factor.
  The value of good farming lands in the East is not very different from
  that of similar lands in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the other great farming
  states of the West.”</p>
<p>“What is the key to the mystery, then?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“Transportation,” answered Ed. “The western farm lands, with an equal
  amount of labor, produce more wheat, corn, pork, and the like, than eastern
  lands do, and it costs next to nothing to carry their wheat, corn, pork,
  etc., to the East.”</p>
<p>“What does it cost?” asked Will.</p>
<p>“Well, I see that the rate is now less than three mills per ton per mile.
  At three mills per ton per mile, ten barrels, or a ton, of flour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> could
  be carried from Chicago to New York for three dollars, or thirty cents
  a barrel. Even at half a cent per ton per mile it would cost only fifty
  cents.”</p>
<p>“While the railroads are engaged in transporting that flour to the hungry
  New Yorkers at that exceedingly reasonable rate,” said Irv, slowly rising
  to his feet, “it is my duty to go below and convert a few insignificant
  pounds of the flour on board into a pan of biscuit, while you, Ed, fry
  some salt pork, the only meat we have left, and heat up a can or two of
  tomatoes.”</p>
<p>This ended the long chat, for besides the preparation of supper there
  was much else to do. There were the lights to be hung in their places,
  and more occupying still, there was the difficult task of tying up the
  boat for the night. For experience had taught Phil caution, and he had
  decided that until <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> should again float
  upon the broad reaches of the Mississippi, she should be securely moored
  to two trees during the hours of darkness. With the Yazoo ten feet above
  its banks, it would have been very easy indeed for the flatboat to drift
  out of the river into the fields and woodlands. And Phil had had all the
  experience he wanted of such wanderings.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">AN OFFER OF HELP</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the day before they reached Vicksburg, the
  planter whose family had been rescued was able to have a long conversation
  with Phil. His first disposition had been to recognize Irv as the master
  spirit of the crew, because of his controlling activity in the matter of
  restoring the starved party to life and health, but he was quickly instructed
  otherwise by Irving himself.</p>
<p>He explained to Phil just who and what he was.</p>
<p>“I have lost a great deal, of course, by this overflow, but fortunately
  the bulk of my cotton crop was already shipped before the flood came, so
  that that is safe. Moreover, I am not altogether dependent upon my planting
  operations. In short,—you will understand that I say this by way of explanation
  and not otherwise,—I am a fairly well-to-do man,—I may even say a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> very
  well-to-do man,—independently of my planting operations.”</p>
<p>“I am glad to hear that,” said Phil, “because it has troubled me a good
  deal, especially as I have looked at Baby and the other children. I have
  wondered what was to become of them, and in what way we boys might best
  help you and them over the bridge.”</p>
<p>“I am glad you said that,” the planter responded. “That gives me the opportunity
  I am seeking. In the same spirit in which you have been thinking of helping
  me, I want you to let me help you and your comrades. I don’t know anything
  of the circumstances of the young men who compose this crew, yourself or
  the others; but I assume that if your circumstances were particularly comfortable,
  you would hardly be engaged in the not very profitable business of running
  a flatboat. At your ages, you would more probably be in school.”</p>
<p>“So we are,” said Phil; “we are none of us particularly well-to-do, but
  we are able to stay at home and go to school. This trip is a kind of a
  lark—or partly that and partly a thing done to restore my brother’s health;
  but we are obliged to make it pay its own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> way,
  anyhow, because we could not afford the trip otherwise. Of course, we are
  out of school for the time being, that is to say, for a few months, but
  we all expect to make that up. As to college, I don’t know. Probably not
  many of us will ever be able to afford that.”</p>
<p>“That, then, is exactly what I want to come to,” said the gentleman. “You
  are obviously boys of good parentage. I cannot offer to pay you for the
  great service you have done to me and mine—no, no; don’t interrupt me now;
  let me say this out. I should not think of insulting you in any such way
  as that; but why should you not let me contribute out of the abundance
  that I still possess to the expense of a college course for all five of
  you very bright young fellows? Believe me, nothing in the world could give
  me a greater gratification than to do this. You have rescued me and mine
  from a fate so terrible that I shudder to think of it even now. Let me
  in my turn help a little to advance your interests in life.”</p>
<p>Phil thought for a considerable time before he replied. Not that he had
  any notion of accepting the offer thus made,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> but
  that he did not want, in rejecting it, to hurt the feelings of a man so
  generous, and one who had made the offer with so much delicacy. At last
  the boy said:—</p>
<p>“Believe me, sir, I appreciate, and all my comrades will when I tell them
  of it, the good feeling and the generosity that have dictated your offer,
  but we could not on any account accept it. I am sure that in this I speak
  for all. I believe that any boy in this country who really wants an education
  can get it, if he chooses to work hard enough and live plainly enough.
  My brother has not been able to go to school much at any time in his life,
  because of his ill-health, and yet he is much the best educated one among
  us, and if he lives, he will be reckoned a well-educated man, even among
  men who are college graduates. As for the rest of us, we can get a college
  education, as I said, if we choose to work hard enough and live hard enough.
  If we don’t choose to do that, why, we must go without. But we thank you
  all the same, and I want you to know that we recognize the generosity of
  your offer, though we cannot accept it. Now, please don’t let’s talk of
  that any more, because it isn’t pleasant to refuse a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> request
  such as yours; for I take it from your manner and tone that you mean it
  as a request rather than as an offer of aid.”</p>
<p>With that, Phil walked away, and there was naturally no more to be said.
  But an hour later the gentleman, who was still feeble from his late exposure
  and suffering, asked Phil again to sit down by him. Then he said:—</p>
<p>“I am not going to reopen the question that we discussed a while ago,
  because I understand and honor your decision with regard to it. But there
  is another little service that I am in position to render you, and that
  I might render to anybody with whom I came into pleasant contact. My name
  counts for a good deal with my commission merchant in New Orleans; for
  how much it counts, it would not be quite modest for me to say; but, at
  any rate, I want to give you a letter to him, if you will allow me. When
  you get there, you will wish to sell your cargo, and of course you will
  be surrounded by buyers, but most of them will be disposed to take advantage
  of your youth and of your inexperience in the market. I cannot imagine
  how, in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> hands,
  you can escape the loss of a considerable part of the value of what you
  have to sell. Now the commission merchant to whom I wish to give you a
  letter is a man of the very highest integrity, besides being my personal
  friend and my agent in business. I suggest that you place the whole matter
  of the sale of your boat and cargo in his hands, and I am confident that
  the difference in the results will be many hundreds of dollars in your
  favor. This is, as I said, a service that I might render even to a casual
  acquaintance. Surely, you will not deny me the privilege of rendering it
  to a group of young men who have done for me what you boys have.”</p>
<p>Phil rose and stood before him embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” he said, “I ought to consult my comrades before accepting
  even this favor at your hands, but I shan’t do anything of the kind. I
  understand what you feel and what you mean, and if you won’t ask anything
  of your commission merchant except that he shall sell us out on his usual
  terms, I shall frankly be very much obliged to you for the letter you offer;
  for it has really been a source of a good deal of anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> to
  me, this thing of how to sell out when we get there.”</p>
<p>It was so arranged; and as the gentleman and his family were to quit the
  boat at Vicksburg, the letter was written that day.</p>
<p>At Vicksburg the boys offered the hospitality of their boat to their guests
  until such time as proper clothing could be provided for them, their condition
  of destitution being one in which it was impossible for them to think of
  going ashore. This offer was frankly accepted, and as the boys were themselves
  in sad need of supplies, the delay of two or three days was not only of
  no consequence to them, but it introduced a new element of life on board <i>The
  Last of the Flatboats</i>. The lady sent into the town for dressmakers
  and seamstresses in such numbers as might enable her quickly to equip herself
  and the children for a reappearance among civilized human beings. The cabin
  became a workroom, and two sewing-machines were installed even upon the
  deck. It looked a little odd, but, as Irv Strong put it, “it’s only another
  incident in a voyage that began with Jim Hughes and promises to end we
  do not know with what. Anyhow, we’ve had good luck on the whole, and if
  we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> don’t
  come out ahead now, it’ll probably be our own fault.”</p>
<p>This was the feeling of all the boys. They had the open Mississippi before
  them for the brief remainder of their journey. The river was still enormously
  full, of course, but it was falling now, and below Vicksburg it had been
  kept well within the levees, so that there was no further probability of
  any cross-country excursions on the part of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>.
  They had nothing to do, apparently, but to cast the boat loose and let
  her float the rest of the way upon placid waters. But this again is getting
  ahead of my story. The boat is still tied to the bank at Vicksburg. Let
  us return to her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">PUBLICITY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the first necessities of their business
  were provided for at Vicksburg, Phil wandered off in search of newspapers.
  He had become interested in many things through his newspaper reading in
  connection with Jim Hughes, and concerning many matters he was curious
  to know the outcome. So he sought not only for the latest newspapers, and
  not chiefly for them, but rather for back numbers covering the period during
  which <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> had been wandering in the woods.
  He secured a lot of them, some of them from New York, some from Chicago,
  some from St. Louis, and some from other cities.</p>
<p>To his astonishment, when he opened the earliest of them,—those that had
  been published soon after the affair at Memphis,—he found them filled with
  portraits of himself and of his companions, with pictures of <i>The Last
  of the Flatboats</i>, and even with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> interviews,
  of which neither he nor Irv Strong, who was the other one chiefly quoted,
  had any recollection. Yet when they read the words quoted from their lips,
  they remembered that these things were substantially what they had said
  to innocent-looking persons not at all known to them as newspaper reporters,
  who had quite casually conversed with them at Memphis. Neither had either
  of them posed for a portrait, and yet here were pictures of them, ranging
  all the way from perfect likenesses to absolute caricatures, freely exploited.</p>
<p>Phil and Irv were so curious about this matter that they asked everybody
  who came on board for an explanation. Finally, one young man, who had come
  to them with an inquiry as to the price at which they would be willing
  to sell out the boat and cargo at Vicksburg instead of going on to New
  Orleans, smiled gently and said, in reply to Phil’s questions:—</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps you don’t always recognize a reporter when you see him.
  Sometimes he may come to you to talk about quite other things than those
  that he really wants you to tell him about. Sometimes your talk will prove
  to be exactly what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> wants
  to interest his readers with, and as a reporter usually has a pretty accurate
  memory, he is able to reproduce all that you say so nearly as you said
  it, that you can’t yourself afterward discover any flaw in his report.
  Sometimes, too, the reporter happens to be an artist sent to get a picture
  of you. He may have a kodak concealed under his vest, but usually that
  does not work. It is clumsy, you know, and generally unsatisfactory. It
  is a good deal easier for a newspaper artist who knows his business to
  talk to you about turnips, or Grover Cleveland, or Christian Science, or
  the tariff, or any of those things that people always talk about, and while
  you think him interested in the expression of your views, make a sketch
  of you on his thumb nail or on his cuff, which he can reproduce at the
  office for purposes of print. By the way, have you talked with any reporters
  since you arrived at Vicksburg?”</p>
<p>“No,” answered Phil; “none of them have come aboard.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure of that?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes; I haven’t seen a single man from the press.”</p>
<p>“Well, if any of the papers should happen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span> to
  ‘get on’ to the fact that you are here, and print something about it, I
  will send you copies in the morning.”</p>
<p>The next morning the promised copies came. One of them contained not only
  a very excellent portrait of Phil and a group picture of the crew, but
  also an almost exact reproduction of the conversation given above.</p>
<p>A new light dawned upon Phil’s mind.</p>
<p>“After all, that fellow was a reporter and a very clever one. He didn’t
  want to buy the boat or its cargo or anything else. But I wonder if he
  was an artist also. If not, who made those pictures?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Irv, “you remember there was a young woman who came on board
  about the same time that he did. She was very much interested in Baby,
  but I noticed that she went all over the boat, and when you and that young
  fellow were talking, she sat down on the anchor, there, and seemed to be
  writing a letter on a pad. Just then, as I remember, we fellows were gathered
  around the new lantern you had just bought and examining it—and, by the
  way, here’s the lantern in the group picture.”</p>
<p>All this was a revelation to Phil, and it interested him mightily. As
  for Irv Strong,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> he
  was so interested that he made up his mind to beard the lion in his den.
  He went to the office of one of the newspapers and asked to see its editor.
  But out of him he got no satisfaction whatever. The editor hadn’t the slightest
  idea where the interviews or the pictures had come from.</p>
<p>“All that,” he said, “is managed by our news department. I never know
  what they are going to do. I judge them only by results. But I do not mind
  saying to you that there would have been several peremptory discharges
  in this office if this paper had not had a good picture of <i>The Last
  of the Flatboats</i>, a portrait of your interesting young captain and
  other pictures of human interest tending to illustrate the arrival of this
  boat at our landing, although we rarely print pictures of any kind in our
  paper. This is an exceptional case. And I think that the chief of our news
  department would have had an uncomfortable quarter of an hour if he and
  his subordinates had failed to secure a talk with persons so interesting
  as those who captured Jim Hughes, as he is called, and secured the arrest
  of the others of that bank burglar’s gang, and afterward rescued one of
  the most distinguished citizens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span> of
  Mississippi and his family from death by starvation. Really, you must excuse
  me from undertaking the task of telling you how our boys do these things.
  It is not my business to know, and I have a great many other things to
  do. It is their business to get the news. For that they are responsible,
  and to that end they have control of adequate means. Oh, by the way, that
  suggests to me a good editorial that ought to be written right now. Perhaps
  you will be interested to read it in to-morrow morning’s paper. I am just
  going to write it.”</p>
<p>As it was now midnight, Irv was bewildered. How in the world was he to
  read in the next morning’s paper an editorial that had, at this hour, just
  occurred to the man who was yet to write it? How was it to be written,
  set up in type, and printed before that early hour when the newspaper must
  be on sale?</p>
<p>The editor knew, if Irv did not. He knew that the hour of midnight sees
  the birth of many of the ablest and most influential newspaper utterances
  of our time. Irv’s curious questions had suggested to him a little essay
  upon the value of Publicity, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> it
  was upon that theme that he wrote. He showed, with what Irv and Phil regarded
  as an extraordinary insight into things that they had supposed to be known
  only to themselves, how their very irregular reading of the newspapers,
  from time to time, as they received them, had first awakened their interest
  in a vague and general way in the bank burglary case; how, as their interest
  became intenser, and the descriptions of the fleeing criminal became more
  and more detailed, they had at last so far coupled one thing with another
  as to reach a correct conclusion at the critical moment. He showed how,
  but for this persistent and minute Publicity, they would never have dreamed
  of arresting the fugitive who was posing as their pilot—how, but for this,
  the criminals would probably never have been caught at all; how their escape
  would have operated as an encouragement to crime everywhere by relieving
  it of the fear of detection,—and much else to the like effect. It was a
  very interesting article, and it was one which set the boys thinking.</p>
<p>“After all,” said Ed, “we owe a great deal more to the newspapers than
  I had ever thought. And the more we think of it, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> more
  we see that we owe it to them. I don’t know whether they are always sincere
  in their antagonism to wrong or not, but at any rate in their rivalry with
  each other to get the earliest news and to stand best with the public,
  they manage pretty generally to expose about all the wrongs there are,
  and to rouse public opinion against them. I suppose that, but for the newspapers,
  we should not have a very good country to live in, especially so far as
  big cities are concerned.”</p>
<p>“As to those sentiments,” said Irv, “I’m afraid one Thomas Jefferson got
  ahead of you, Ed. I remember reading that he said somewhere, that he would
  rather have a free press without a free government than a free government
  without a free press. I imagine his meaning to have been that we could
  not long have a free government without a free press, and that if we have
  a free press it must pretty soon compel the setting up of a free government.”</p>
<p>“But the newspapers do publish such dreadful things,” said Constant. “They
  make so many sensations that their moral influence, I suppose, is pretty
  bad.”</p>
<p>“Well, is it?” asked Irv. “If there is a pest-hole in any city, where
  typhus or smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> is
  breeding, and a newspaper exposes it, it is not pleasant reading, of course,
  but it arouses public attention and brings public opinion to bear to compel
  a remedy. If there is a health board, the newspapers all want to know what
  the health board is doing; if there isn’t a health board, the newspapers
  all cry out, ‘Why isn’t there a health board?’ and presently one is organized.
  Now I suppose it is very much the same way about moral plague spots. If
  vice or crime prevail in any part of the city, the newspapers print the
  news of it and call upon the police to suppress it. This arouses public
  attention and brings pressure to bear upon public officials until the bad
  thing is done away with, or at least reduced to small proportions.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed, thinking and speaking slowly, “and there is another thing.
  Even when the newspapers print the details about scandals, and we say it
  would be better not to publish such things, it may be that the newspapers
  are right; because every rascal that is inclined to do scandalous things
  knows by experience or observation that the newspapers, if they get hold
  of the facts, will print them and hold him up to the execration of mankind.
  If the newspapers did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> not
  print the news of such things, every scoundrel would know that he could
  do what he pleased without fear of being made the subject of scandal. The
  first thought of every rascal seems to be to keep his affairs out of the
  newspapers. Now perhaps it is better that he cannot keep them out; as he
  certainly cannot. In very many cases, without doubt or question, men are
  restrained from doing outrageous things merely by the fear that their conduct
  will be exploited with pictures of themselves and fac-similes of their
  letters and everything of the kind, in so-called sensational newspapers.”</p>
<p>“Well, all that is so, I suppose,” said Will, “though I hadn’t thought
  of it quite to the extent that you have, Ed. I have always been told that
  the newspapers were horribly sensational and immoral, but, now that I think
  of it, when they publish a story of immorality, it is because somebody
  has been doing the immoral thing that they report; and as you say, the
  fact that the newspapers are pretty sure to get hold of the truth and publish
  it in every case is often a check on men’s tendency to do immoral things.”</p>
<p>Before parting with their rescued friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> at
  Vicksburg, the boys had to go ashore and be photographed, at the planter’s
  solicitation.</p>
<p>“I want my children always to think of you young men as their friends,”
  he said,—“friends to whom they owe more than they can ever repay. I don’t
  want ‘Baby’ to forget you as she might—she is so young still—if she did
  not have your portraits to remind her as she grows older. As for myself
  and my wife—I cannot say how much of gratitude we feel. There are some
  things that one can’t even try to say. But be sure—” He broke down here,
  but the boys understood.</p>
<p>Irv Strong, whose objection to anything like a “scene” is a familiar fact
  to the reader, diverted the conversation by saying:—</p>
<p>“It would be a pity to perpetuate the memory of these clothes of ours,
  or to let the little ones learn as they grow up what a ragamuffin crew
  it was with whom an unfortunate accident once compelled them to associate
  for a time. So suppose we have only our faces photographed now, and send
  you pictures of our best clothes when we get back home.”</p>
<p>The triviality served its purpose, and the party went to the photographer’s.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>
<p>When the time of leave taking came there were tears on the part of the
  mother and the children, while “Baby” stoutly insisted upon remaining on
  the flatboat with “my big boys,” as she called her rescuers. She was especially
  in love with Phil, who, in spite of his absorbing duties, had found time
  to play with her and tell her wonderful stories. During the clothes-making
  wait at Vicksburg, indeed, Phil had done little else than entertain the
  beautiful big-eyed child. He repeated to her all the nursery rhymes and
  jingles he had ever heard in his infancy or since, and to the astonishment
  of his companions, he made up many jingles of his own for her amusement.
  He made up funny stories for her too,—stories that were funny only because
  he illustrated them with comical faces and grotesque gestures.</p>
<p>So when the time of parting came the child clung to him, and had to be
  torn away in tears. I suppose I ought not to tell it on Phil, but he too
  had to turn aside from the others and use his handkerchief on his eyes
  before he could give the command to “cast off” in a husky and not very
  steady voice.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">DOWN “THE COAST”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moon was gibbous in its approach to the
  full when the boat left Vicksburg. So all the way to their journey’s end
  the boys had moonlight of evenings except when fog obscured it briefly,
  and that was not often.</p>
<p>As they floated down the river, with subtropical scenery on either hand,
  with palms and live-oaks and other perennial trees giving greenery of the
  greenest possible kind at a season of the year when at their home not a
  leaf remained alive and all the trees were gaunt skeletons, the boys lived
  in something like a dream. And at night the moonlight, immeasurably more
  brilliant than any they had ever seen, additionally stimulated their imaginations
  and captivated their fancy.</p>
<p>“That is Baton Rouge,” said Ed, as they came within sight of a city on
  the left side of the river. “It means ‘red stick.’”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why in the world did anybody ever name a town ‘red stick’?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“Why, because when Tecumseh came down this way to persuade all the Indians
  to join in a war upon the whites, as I told you up in New Madrid Bend,
  he offered red sticks to the warriors. All that accepted them were thereby
  pledged to join in the war. It was here that the first red sticks were
  distributed, and so this spot was called ‘Baton Rouge.’”</p>
<p>“But why didn’t they call it ‘Red Sticks’ and have done with it?” asked
  Will. “Why did they translate it into French?”</p>
<p>“The Indians didn’t know English,” answered Ed. “The French first explored
  the Mississippi, and they not only gave French names to everything, but
  they taught a rude sort of French to the Indians. There is a town on the
  upper Mississippi called ‘Prairie du Chien.’ That means ‘the prairie of
  the dog.’ Then there is ‘Marquette’ in Wisconsin, named after a great French
  missionary and explorer. And there is Dubuque, and there are half a dozen
  other places with old French names. In Arkansas there is a river called
  the ‘St. François.’ And the name Arkansas itself was originally a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> French
  effort to spell the Indian word ‘Arkansaw.’ By the way, the Legislature
  of that state has passed a law declaring that the proper pronunciation
  of the state’s name is ‘Arkansaw.’ It is said that when James K. Polk,
  afterward President, was speaker of the House of Representatives, there
  were two congressmen there from Arkansas. One of them always pronounced
  his state’s name ‘Arkansas,’ as if it were English, and with the accent
  on the second syllable, while the other always called it ‘Arkansaw.’ Polk
  was so excessively polite that when either of the two arose to speak, he
  recognized him as ‘the gentleman from Arkansas’ or as ‘the gentleman from
  Arkansaw,’ accordingly as the gentleman recognized was in the habit of
  pronouncing the word.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” said Phil. “And I suppose the same thing is true
  about the ‘Tensaw’ country in Alabama. I see that it is spelled on most
  maps ‘Tensas,’ but on some it is spelled ‘Tensaw,’ and I suppose that is
  the right pronunciation.”</p>
<p>“It is,” said Ed. “And then there is the Ouachita River. Its name is pronounced
  ‘Washitaw,’ but spelled in the French way. I once heard of a man who stayed
  in New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> Orleans
  for six weeks, looking every day for the advertisement of some steamboat
  going up that river. He saw announcements of boats for the Ouachita River,
  of course, but none for the ‘Washitaw.’ Finally, somebody enlightened him.
  You see these French names were bestowed when French was the only language
  of this region, and they have survived.”</p>
<p>The boys were studying the map by the almost superfluous light of a lantern.
  Presently one of them said:—</p>
<p>“A little way down the river, on the western bank, is a place called Plaquemine.
  That also is French, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” answered Ed, “and it is a region with an interesting history.
  It was there that the Acadians went when they were driven out of their
  home in British America. Longfellow tells all about it in the poem ‘Evangeline.’
  I’ll read some of it,” he added, rising to go below for the book.</p>
<p>“No, don’t,” pleaded Irv. “That poem gives me ‘that tired feeling.’ Its
  story is beautiful. Its sentiment is all that could be desired. But its
  metre makes me feel as if I were stumbling over stones in the dark.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’ll bet your favorite wager, a brass button, Irv, that you can’t quote
  a single line of the poem you are so ready to criticise,” said Will Moreraud,
  who was Longfellow mad, as his comrades said.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll take that bet,” said Irv. “And I’ll give you odds. I’ll bet
  seven brass buttons to your one that I can, off hand, repeat the worst
  and clumsiest four lines in the whole poem.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” said Will. “I’ll buy a glittering brass button in New Orleans,
  ‘scalloped all the way round and halfway back,’ as the boy said of his
  ginger cakes, and pay the bet if I lose.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Irv. “Here goes:—</p>
<div>
  <p class="poem"> ‘Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;<br />
    For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,<br />
    All things were held in common, and what one had was another’s.<br />
    Yet under Benedict’s roof hospitality seemed more abundant.’”<br />
  </p>
</div>
<p>“It really doesn’t sound like poetry,” said Phil. “But then, I’m no judge.
  All the same, Irv wins the bet, and I’ll exercise my authority as commander
  of this craft and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> company
  to compel you, Will, to buy and deliver that brass button.”</p>
<p>“But how do you know that those four lines are the worst in the poem?”
  asked Will.</p>
<p>“Because there simply couldn’t be worse ones,” said Phil, “and unless
  you produce some others equally bad, I shall hold these to be the worst.”</p>
<p>“Now,” said Ed, “you fellows are very free with your criticisms. But perhaps
  you don’t know as much as you might. Longfellow undertook to write in hexameters.
  We all know what hexameters are, because we have all read some Latin poetry.
  But there is this difficulty: a hexameter line must end in a spondee—or
  a foot of two long or equally accented syllables. Now there is only here
  and there a word in the whole English language that is a spondee. The only
  spondees available in English are made up of two long, or two equally accented
  monosyllables. That is why the metre of Evangeline is so hard to read with
  ease, or at any rate it is one of the reasons. Longfellow uses trochees—that
  is to say, feet composed of one long and one short syllable, instead. In
  one case he uses the word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> ‘baptism’
  as a spondee, but in fact it is a dactyl, consisting of one long and two
  short syllables. Edgar Allan Poe pointed that out.”</p>
<p>“Why did he write in that metre, then,” asked Will, “if it is impossible
  in English?”</p>
<p>“Because he was a Greek and Latin scholar, and was so enamored of the
  hexameter verse that he tried to reproduce it in English. He didn’t accomplish
  the purpose, but he wrote some mighty good things in trying to do it.”</p>
<p>“But tell us, Ed,” said Constant, “why did Evangeline’s people come all
  the way down here?”</p>
<p>“They were French, and they naturally sought for a country where the French
  constituted the greater part of the population. This wasn’t English territory
  then. By the way, that reminds me of a good Vevay story. When I was a very
  little boy, I used to go occasionally to pay my respects to the oldest
  lady in town—‘Grandmother Grisard,’ as we all reverently called her. She
  was a lovely old lady, and she once told me how she came to Vevay. She
  set out from Switzerland very early in this century, being then a young
  girl, to come to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> French-settled
  Red River country, where her people had friends. But there are two Red
  Rivers in America, this one and the Red River of the North, which runs
  from Minnesota northward into Manitoba. Europeans were rather weak on American
  geography in those days, so instead of bringing this young girl to the
  Red River of Louisiana, the transportation people took her to the Red River
  of the North. That region was then entirely wild. Indians and Canadian
  half-breeds were practically its only inhabitants, and so the young Swiss
  girl was in the greatest peril.</p>
<p>“She learned, after a while, that some Swiss people had settled at Vevay,
  in what was then the wild, uninhabited Northwest Territory. So she set
  out to find Vevay, and to find people that could talk her own mother tongue.
  It was an awful journey across the wild, savage-haunted prairie region
  that now constitutes Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, but she
  made it. It required months of time. It involved terrible hardships and
  fearful dangers from the Indians. But after the long struggle the young
  Swiss girl reached Vevay and was again among people of her own race, who
  spoke her own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> language.
  She soon after married the most prosperous man in the village, Mr. Grisard,
  and, as you all know, her sons and her grandsons have ever since been men
  of mark in the town.”<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>“Good for you, Ed!” said Will Moreraud. “We fellows of Swiss descent thank
  you. We are all more or less akin to Grandmother Grisard, after two or
  three generations of intermarriages, and now that we know her story we
  shall cherish it as a family legend of our own. In fact, I suspect that
  our Swiss forefathers and foremothers made a pretty good place out of Vevay
  before the Virginians and Yankees and Scotch-Irish from whom you fellows
  sprang ever thought of settling there.”</p>
<p>“Of course they did,” said Ed; “that’s why our people settled there. The
  Swiss settlers must have been people of the highest character, or their
  descendants wouldn’t be the foremost citizens of the town, as they are
  to-day. It is a curious fact, by the way, that when they settled at Vevay
  they tried to do precisely what they and their ancestors had always done
  in their own country,—they planted vineyards, and set out to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> wine.
  My father, before he died, told me that in his boyhood four-fifths of the
  lands cultivated by the Swiss were planted in vineyards. Henry Clay was
  greatly interested in their work, and tried hard to introduce Vevay wine
  in Washington, and to secure tariff protection for it.”</p>
<p>“What became of the vineyards?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“Why, the temperance wave destroyed them. It came to be thought wrong,
  and even disreputable, to make or sell wine, or anything else that had
  alcohol in it. So, little by little, the Swiss people, who were always,
  above all things, reputable and moral, dug up their vineyards, and planted
  corn instead.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Will Moreraud. “I remember hearing a rather pretty story on
  that subject concerning a kinsman of my own. He had his dear old grandmother—or
  great-grandmother, I forget which—as an inmate of his house, and when the
  movement to convert the vineyards into cornfields was at its height, the
  old lady strenuously objected. She said that she had been born in a vineyard,
  and had all her life looked out upon vineyards through every window.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> My
  kinsman was very tender of his grandmother’s feelings. But at the same
  time he was resolved to change his vineyards into cornfields. He knew that
  the old lady could never leave the house, owing to her great age and infirmities.
  So he went to every window in every story of the house and studied the
  landscape. Having ascertained precisely how far it was possible for the
  old lady to see from the windows of the house, he ordered all the vineyards
  beyond her line of vision destroyed, and all within it preserved.”</p>
<p>“Beautiful!” cried Phil. “There ought to be more men like that one, if
  only to make the dear old grandmothers happy in the evening of their lives.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps there are more of them than you think,” said Constant. “It’s
  my impression that men generally are pretty good fellows, if you really
  find out about them.”</p>
<p>“Of course they are,” said Ed. “Does it occur to you that when we fellows
  undertook this flatboat enterprise, every man in Vevay stood generously
  ready to help? It is always so. Men are usually kindly and generous if
  they have a chance to be. As for women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>—”</p>
<p>“God bless them!” cried Irv, rising to his six feet of height.</p>
<p>“<i>So-say-we-all-of-us!</i>” chanted Phil, to the familiar tune, while
  the rest joined in.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">A TALK ON DECK</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> latter end of the voyage was uneventful
  in outward ways at least, but it led to some things, as we shall see later
  on, that were of more consequence in the lives of the five boys than all
  the strenuous happenings which had gone before.</p>
<p>The boat no longer leaked. A few minutes’ pumping once in every two or
  three hours was sufficient to keep her bilge free from water. The river,
  though falling rapidly, was still full, but the levees were keeping it
  within bounds, and there were no crevasses to avoid. There were fogs now
  and then, but the flatboat floated through them without any apparent disposition
  to run away again. There were the three meals a day to cook, and the lanterns
  to keep in order, but beyond that and the washing of clothes, sheets, and
  the like, there was literally nothing to do but talk.</p>
<p>And how they did talk! And of how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> many
  different things! We have heard one of their conversations. Suppose we
  listen to some more of them.</p>
<p>“I say, Ed,” said Irv, “with this wonderful river bringing the products
  of a score of states to New Orleans for a market, how is it that New Orleans
  isn’t the greatest port in the country?”</p>
<p>“It came near being so once. It was New York’s chief rival, and some day
  it may be again. So long as there were no railroads New Orleans was the
  chief outlet, and inlet as well, for all this great western and southern
  country. Not only did most of the western produce and southern cotton come
  to it for sale at home or shipment abroad, but most of the foreign goods
  imported for the use of the West and South came in through New Orleans,
  and so did most of the passengers who wanted to reach any point west of
  the Alleghenies.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t it go on in that way?” asked Constant.</p>
<p>“In the first place, a wise governor of New York, De Witt Clinton, persuaded
  the people of that state to make some artificial geography. They dug canals
  to connect the Great Lakes with the Hudson River.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> This
  enabled them to carry western produce to New York all the way by water,
  and as cheaply as it could be carried down the river—more cheaply, in fact,
  so far as that part of it grown far away from the rivers was concerned.
  This gave New York a very great advantage. For New York is a thousand miles
  or more nearer to Europe than New Orleans is, and so if grain could be
  landed in New York at smaller expense than in New Orleans, that was the
  cheapest as well as the shortest route to Europe.</p>
<p>“Then again New Orleans lies in a much hotter climate than New York, and
  so do the seas over which freight from New Orleans must be carried. In
  a hot climate grain is apt to sprout and spoil, or it was so until comparatively
  recent years, when means of preventing that were discovered.”</p>
<p>Ed stopped, as if he had finished. Will wanted more and asked for it.</p>
<p>“Go on,” he said. “Tell us all about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, do,” echoed the others.</p>
<p>“I am not sure that I know ‘all about it,’” answered Ed, “but I have been
  reading some articles concerning it since our trip awakened my interest,
  and if you want me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> to
  do so, I’ll tell you what I have learned from them.”</p>
<p>“Do!” cried Irv. “This party of young Hoosiers has often been hungrier
  for corned beef and cabbage, with all that those terms imply, than for
  intellectual pabulum of any kind whatever. But at present our physical
  systems are abundantly fed. What we want now is intellectual refreshment,
  all of which, being interpreted, means ‘Go on, Ed; we’re interested.’”</p>
<p>Ed laughed, and continued:—</p>
<p>“Well, the war damaged New Orleans, of course, not only by shutting up
  the port for some years, but by impoverishing the southern states which
  New Orleans supplied with provisions and goods and from which it drew cotton.
  Then, again, New York had and still has most of the free money there is
  in this country, the money that is hunting for something to do. You know
  that money is like a man in this respect. It always wants to earn wages.
  Now, when the western farmer sells his grain and the like to a country
  merchant, he wants money for it. As a great many farmers sell at the same
  time, the country merchant naturally hasn’t enough money of his own to
  satisfy them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> all.
  So he ships the grain, etc., as fast as he receives it, and makes drafts
  upon the commission merchants to whom he is sending it. That is to say,
  he makes them pay in advance for produce shipped in order that he may have
  the money with which to buy more when it is offered. The commission merchants
  in their turn borrow the money from the banks in their cities, giving liens
  on the grain for security. This is a very rough explanation, of course,
  but you can see from it how the city that has the largest amount of money
  ‘hunting for a job’ must draw to itself, when other things are anywhere
  near equal, the greater part of all the produce that can go at about the
  same cost to that or some other city.”</p>
<p>“That’s clear enough,” said Phil. “But what about the railroads? Why do
  they all seem to run to New York?”</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting point,” answered Ed. “I’m glad you reminded me
  of it. When the railroads were built, each little road was independent
  of all the rest. But each of them wanted to reach New York, because the
  artificial geography created by New York’s canals had made that the country’s
  greatest port, and because New York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[341]</a></span> had
  more money to lend on produce, as I have explained, than any other city.
  So as the numberless little railroad lines consolidated themselves into
  great trunk lines, they all made for New York as eagerly as flies make
  for an open sugar barrel. Even the Baltimore and Ohio road, which was built
  by Baltimore people to make Baltimore a rival of New York, spent money
  in lavish millions to secure a New York terminus and make Baltimore a way
  station. To sum it all up, the farmer wants to sell to the local merchant
  who will pay him in cash; the local merchant ships his purchases to Chicago
  or any other intermediate city whose commission merchants will make the
  biggest and quickest advances of money on the grain, etc., before it arrives;
  the merchants in the intermediate cities ship to the port whose commission
  merchants will make them the largest advances in their turn and thus enable
  them to go on buying while the opportunity lasts. That city is New York.
  Of course this is only a general statement. There is often plenty of money
  to lend in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and lately those cities
  and Newport News in Virginia have taken a good deal of New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> York’s
  grain trade. But what I have said will explain to you one of the reasons
  why New Orleans ‘isn’t in it,’ in this matter.”</p>
<p>“Then our wonderful river no longer renders a service to the country?”
  said Constant, interrogatively.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, it does,” answered Ed, eagerly. “It still carries vast quantities
  of goods to New Orleans, not only for consumption in the South, but for
  shipment abroad. And even if it carried nothing, it would still be rendering
  a service of incalculable value to the country.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked all the boys, in a breath.</p>
<p>“By compelling the railroads to carry freight at reasonable rates. Let
  me tell you some facts in illustration. Somewhere about the year 1870—a
  little before, I think it was—the railroads were charging extortionate
  prices for carrying freight to eastern cities. Some great merchants and
  steamboat owners put their heads together to stop the extortion. They organized
  the Mississippi Valley Transportation Company, to carry freight down the
  river to the sea. They built great stern-wheel steamboats, and set them
  to push vast fleets of barges loaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> with
  freight to New Orleans. This so enormously cheapened freight rates that
  the railroads were threatened with ruin, and New Orleans seemed likely
  to take New York’s place as the country’s great grain-exporting city. The
  railroads began at once to reduce their rates in self-defence, and from
  that day to this they have had to reduce them more and more, lest the water
  routes, and chiefly the Mississippi River, should take their trade away
  from them. So you see that even if not one ton of freight were carried
  over our wonderful river, which, in fact, carries hundreds of millions
  of tons, it would still be rendering an enormous service to the country
  by keeping railroad freight rates down.”</p>
<p>The boys pondered these things awhile. Then Irv said:—</p>
<p>“But you said awhile ago that New Orleans might some day again become
  New York’s rival as a shipping port. Would you mind telling us just what
  you meant by that?”</p>
<p>“Why, no,” said Ed, hesitating. “I suppose I was thinking of the time,
  which is surely coming, when this great, rich Mississippi Valley of ours
  will be as densely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span> populated
  as other and less productive parts of the earth are.”</p>
<p>“For instance?” said Will, interrogatively.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose,” said Ed, “that the great Mississippi Valley fairly
  represents our whole country as to population. We have in this country,
  according to a statistical book that I have here, about 20 people, big
  and little, to the square mile, or somewhat less. Now the Netherlands,
  according to the same book, have about 351, Belgium about 529, and England
  about 540 people to the square mile. In other words, we must multiply ourselves
  by 26 or 27 before we shall have as dense a population as England now has.
  When we have 27 times as many people in the Mississippi Valley as we now
  have, I don’t think there is much doubt that New Orleans will be just as
  important a port and just as big a city as her most ambitious citizen would
  like her to be.”</p>
<p>The boys sat silent for a while. Then Irv took out a pencil and paper,
  and figured for a few minutes. Finally he broke silence.</p>
<p>“Do I understand that this country of ours is capable—taking it by and
  large—of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[345]</a></span> supporting
  a population as great to the square mile as that of England, or anything
  like as great?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why not,” said Ed. “Our agriculture is in its infancy, we
  are merely scratching the surface, and not a very large part of the surface
  at that. We have arid and desert regions, of course, but on the other hand,
  we have a richer soil and an immeasurably more fruitful climate than England
  has. England can’t grow a single bushel of corn, for example, while we
  grow more than two billion bushels every year. It seems to me clear that
  our country, taken as a whole, and this rich Mississippi Valley especially,
  can support a much larger population to the square mile than England can.”</p>
<p>“Well, if it ever does,” said Irv, referring to his figures, “we shall
  have a population of about two billion people, or very many times more
  than the greatest nations in all history ever had.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Phil. “Isn’t ours the greatest nation in all history
  in the way it has stood for liberty and right and progress? Why shouldn’t
  it be immeasurably the greatest in population and wealth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> everything
  else? Why shouldn’t we multiply our seventy millions or so of people into
  the billions?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, why not?” asked Irv. “It would only mean that twenty or thirty
  times as many men as ever before would enjoy the blessing of liberty.”</p>
<p>“It would mean vastly more than that,” said Ed.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Irv.</p>
<p>“It would mean that twenty or thirty times as many men <i>stood</i> for
  liberty throughout all the earth; it would mean that twenty or thirty times
  as many men as ever before were ready to fight for liberty and human right.
  It would mean even more than that. It would mean that the Great Republic,
  planted upon the theory of absolute and equal liberty, would so enormously
  outweigh all other nations combined, in numbers and in physical and moral
  force, that no nation and no coalition of nations would ever dare dispute
  our country’s decisions or balk her will. We should in that case dominate
  the world by our numbers, our wealth, and our productiveness. For in the
  very nature of things, countries that already have from twenty to twenty-five
  times our population to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span> square
  mile cannot hope to grow as we inevitably shall.”</p>
<p>“But what if we don’t continue to stand for liberty and human right?”
  asked Phil. “What if we forget our national mission, and use our vast power
  not for freedom, but for conquest; not for the right, but for the wrong?”</p>
<p>“That is what every American citizen owes it to his country to guard against
  by his vote,” answered Ed.</p>
<p>“In other words,” said Irv “that’s what we are here for.”</p>
<p>“Precisely,” said Ed. “But it is time to get supper, and I, for one, am
  hungry.”</p>
<p>“So am I,” responded Irv, as he went below to bear his share in the supper
  getting.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">LOOKING FORWARD</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the last night of the voyage that
  Phil broached the thought that he had been turning over in his mind ever
  since his talk with the rescued Mississippi planter. The journey was practically
  finished. <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> would reach New Orleans about
  ten o’clock the next morning. The big round moon illuminated the broad,
  placid river. Supper was ended. The lights were in their places. There
  was no water in the bilge. The day’s work was done, and the hardy young
  fellows were lolling about the deck, talking all sorts of trivial things,
  when Phil introduced the subject.</p>
<p>“I say, boys, does it occur to you that we fellows have a splendid opportunity
  before us if we choose to accept it?”</p>
<p>“Are you meditating a jump overboard?” asked Irv, “or did you just now
  remember the great truth that fills my mind, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> that
  there’s enough of that beef pie left to make a good midnight supper all
  round?”</p>
<p>“No, for once I’m serious, Irv,” said Phil, whose new habit of seriousness
  had grown upon him with increasing responsibility, until all the boys observed
  the change in him with wonder, not unmixed with amusement.</p>
<p>“All right, then,” said Irv; “go ahead. We’re ‘at attention.’”</p>
<p>“What is it, Phil?” asked Will Moreraud, seeing that Irv’s light chatter
  annoyed the boy, or at the least distracted his attention. “You’ve something
  worth while to say. So we’ll listen.”</p>
<p>Phil broke into the middle of his subject.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t we fellows all get a college education?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Our parents aren’t able to give it to us,” answered Constant.</p>
<p>“No, but we are able to get it for ourselves,” answered Phil. “That gentleman
  up there in Mississippi wanted to help us do it, but I refused that offer
  for the whole party.”</p>
<p>Then he reported the conversation he had had with the planter, and his
  comrades heartily approved his course in refusing assistance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<p>“But we can do the thing ourselves,” Phil continued. “Let me explain.
  After we built this flatboat and equipped her and made up a purse for our
  running expenses, we each had about a hundred dollars of our pig-iron money
  left. Since then we have made one thousand dollars apiece out of the Jim
  Hughes affair. So when we get back home we shall have eleven hundred dollars
  apiece to the good, besides whatever we make clear out of the trip. That
  ought to be considerably more, but we won’t count it because it’s a chicken
  that isn’t hatched yet. At any rate, it will more than pay our fares back
  to Vevay, so when we get home we shall have eleven or twelve hundred dollars
  apiece. Now that is plenty to take us through college.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Irv. “I hear of young college men who spend
  from one thousand to five thousand dollars a year.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Phil, “and I read in a newspaper the other day of a man
  who paid five hundred dollars for a bouquet to give to the girl he was
  about to marry. But we aren’t young men with ‘liberal allowances’ and we
  aren’t bouquet buyers. Listen to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> me.
  I have figured it all out carefully. At many colleges there is no charge
  at all for tuition. At others there are scholarships that can be made to
  cover tuition. At most of the colleges in the West and South the tuition
  fees are very small, even if we must pay them. The principal things we’ve
  got to look out for are board, clothes, and books. We can wear the same
  clothes at college that we should wear at home, and our parents will provide
  them, or if they can’t, we can earn them during vacations. Our necessary
  books for the whole course won’t cost us more than fifty or sixty dollars
  apiece if we work together as I’m going to suggest. That leaves only the
  question of board.”</p>
<p>“Well, board will cost us five dollars a week apiece or two hundred a
  year, at any decent boarding-house,” said Irv.</p>
<p>“Of course,” answered Phil. “But I propose that we shan’t live at any
  decent boarding-house.”</p>
<p>“How, then?”</p>
<p>“Why, you see we’re an exceptional lot of young fellows in some respects.
  Our classmates in college, when we go there, may know a great deal more
  than we do about many things, and probably they will. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> we
  know some very valuable things that they do not. We know how to take care
  of ourselves. For a good many weeks now we have bought and cooked our own
  food and washed our own dishes, and even our own clothes. At college we
  could hire the laundry work done, but why shouldn’t we do all the rest
  for ourselves?”</p>
<p>“Go on,” cried Irv when Phil paused. “I for one am interested, and it’s
  obvious you’ve thought out the whole thing, Phil. Tell us all about your
  plan.”</p>
<p>Phil hesitated a little, abashed by the approval and admiration which
  he easily detected in Irv’s eager tone and in the faces of his comrades.
  At last he resumed:—</p>
<p>“Well, you see, we five fellows not only know how to cook and all that
  sort of thing, but we know how to live together without quarrelling, and
  how to work together for a common purpose. Why shouldn’t we go to some
  college where there are no tuition fees, or very small ones, hire two rooms,
  one to cook and eat in, and the other to sleep in, buy the ten or twenty
  dollars’ worth of plain furniture necessary, and board ourselves just as
  we are doing now?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>
<p>The other boys paused, interested in the idea. Presently Constant asked:—</p>
<p>“How much apiece do you reckon the cost of board to be?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t figured it out in detail,” said Phil. “I’ve left that for Ed
  to do. You remember he made a calculation away up the river as to how much
  it costs to feed a man for a year.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Ed, speaking the word slowly as if thinking; “but that calculation
  hardly fits the case. It related to a single person, and we are five persons.
  We can live more cheaply together than five persons could live separately.
  Besides, that calculation up the river was made on a guess-work basis.
  It is very much better to base the calculation on facts, and fortunately
  I have the facts.”</p>
<p>“What?” “Where did you get them?” These and like exclamations greeted
  Ed’s announcement.</p>
<p>“Well, you see,” said Ed, “I have been keeping accounts in order to find
  out what it has cost us just to live on this voyage. I’ve set down the
  exact cost of everything we started with and everything we have bought
  since, including the two cords of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> wood
  we bought for the cooking-stove, and which we haven’t used up yet. I’ll
  figure the thing up and tell you exactly what it will cost us to board
  ourselves at college, provided we are willing to live as plainly there
  as we do on this boat.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” called out Irv. “We’ve lived like fighting cocks all the way
  down the river—except that we’ve run out of milk pretty often.”</p>
<p>“Do fighting cocks consume large quantities of milk, Irv?” asked Phil.</p>
<p>“No, of course not. You know what I mean. I’m satisfied to live in college
  precisely as we have lived on the flatboat, and if I drink more milk, I
  suppose I shall make it up by eating just so much less of other things.”</p>
<p>“Do you hear that, boys?” called out Constant. “Irv agrees that if we
  go to college together he’ll eat one pancake less for every extra glass
  of milk he drinks. Remember that. We shall hold him rigidly to his bargain.”</p>
<p>By this time Ed, who had gone to the forward lantern to do his figuring,—for
  one really cannot “see to read” by even the brightest moonlight, as people
  often say and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> think
  they can,—was ready to report results. He said:—</p>
<p>“Counting in everything we have bought to eat, and everything that the
  Cincinnati banker gave us at Memphis, and the cost of our fuel, I find
  that it has cost us for our table, precisely $3.98 per week, as an average,
  since the day we left Vevay to drop down to Craig’s Landing. Let us say
  $4.00. That’s 80 cents apiece per week, for we won’t reckon Jim Hughes’s
  board. The college year is forty weeks, or a little less. At 80 cents a
  week apiece, we can feed ourselves on $32 a year each, or only $128 each
  for the whole four years’ course.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Phil, “now let’s figure a little.” With that he went to the
  light and made some calculations. On his return he said, “I reckon it this
  way:—</p>
<table id="course" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="Calculation
for cost of a course.">
  <tr>
    <td>Rent $10 a year for each, or for the course</td>
    <td class="tdr">$40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Board for each, $32 a year, or for the course</td>
    <td class="tdr">128</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fuel, lights, and incidentals—say for each</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tuition, if we have to pay it, for each</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>or a grand total of $308 apiece for the whole course. For safety, and
  to cover miscalculations and accidents and illness and all the rest of
  it, let’s just double the figures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> That
  gives us a total possible expense of $616, or just about one-half the money
  that each of us has in hand, and that we ought to be ready to spend to
  make the best men we can out of ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Boys!” said Will Moreraud, rising in his enthusiasm, “I move this resolution
  right here and now:—</p>
<p>“‘Resolved, that Phil Lowry is a brick! Resolved, that we five fellows
  shall go together to a college of Phil Lowry’s selection, live in the economical
  way he suggests, and so diligently do our work as to take all the honors
  there are going in that college, and astonish the fellows whose education
  has not included a flatboat experience in the art of taking care of oneself.’”</p>
<p>The resolution was adopted without dissent. Then Phil had something more
  to say:—</p>
<p>“Now, fellows, I’m a good way behind the rest of you in some of my studies.
  I’m younger than you—but that’s no matter. I’ll not ‘plead the baby act,’
  anyhow. All of you can easily prepare yourselves for college between now
  and next fall. You probably don’t believe it, but so can I, and so I will.
  I have never set myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> to
  study in earnest. I’m going to do it now. When we get home, I’ll bring
  to bear all that ‘obstinate pertinacity’ that you and Mrs. Dupont credit
  me with or blame me for—whichever way you choose to put it. If I don’t
  pass entrance examinations next fall with the best of you, you can count
  my share of the money as a voluntary contribution to the expenses of the
  mess. But you’d better not count on it in that way, I warn you.”</p>
<p>“Of course we hadn’t,” said Irv Strong, as Phil went below to look after
  things. “I’ve got a great, big, rosy-cheeked, candy apple at home, and
  I’ll wager it against the insignificant head of any fellow in the party—yours
  included, Ed—that when we five fellows present ourselves for our entrance
  examinations next fall, Phil Lowry will knock the spots out of every one
  of us.”</p>
<p>“You expect too much of him, Irv,” said Ed. “It isn’t fair. He’s from
  a year to two years behind us, and he is the youngest and most immature
  in the party.”</p>
<p>“Is he?” asked Irv, with challenge in his voice. “He may have been so
  when we left Vevay, but he isn’t now. He’s the oldest of us now and the
  most mature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> among
  us. You saw how he managed things in the woods, and how he handled Jim
  Hughes, and how he managed the difficult problem of the tarpaulin, and
  all the rest of it. I tell you, Ed, that, while Phil Lowry was much the
  youngest boy in this company when we made him ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>’
  for this voyage, he is several years older to-day than any of us. He may
  be a class behind some of you fellows in mere book work, but he won’t stay
  so long. I’ll tell you what, Ed, you’ll have to stir all your stumps to
  keep up with that fellow in college. He has got his mettle up now.”</p>
<p>“I believe that is so,” said Ed, thinking, and speaking slowly. “I hadn’t
  thought of it, Irv, but Phil has developed in his mind surprisingly during
  this voyage.”</p>
<p>“So much so,” replied Irv, “that nobody in this crew is his equal when
  it comes to real, hard, clear-headed thinking.”</p>
<p>“That is so,” said Ed, reflectively; “but in book study he is behind all
  of us because he is younger. He says he’ll catch up and—”</p>
<p>“And we now know him too well to doubt that he will do all that he says,”
  broke in Will Moreraud, whose admiration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> for
  Phil had grown day by day until now it scarcely knew any bounds. “But I
  say, fellows,” continued Will, “we’ve got to help Phil catch up. For that
  matter, there isn’t one of us that hasn’t a lame duck of some sort. Even
  you, Ed—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘even’ me,” said Ed. “I’m in fact the worst of the lot. I’ve
  gone ahead of you fellows,—in my irregular fashion, of course,—but I’ve
  skipped a lot of things, and I’ve got to bring them up before I can pass
  my examinations for college.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Will, who was now enthusiastic. “Why shouldn’t
  we fellows form a ‘study club’ this fall, and work together? Of course
  the high school won’t and can’t prepare us for college by next year. But
  we can and will prepare ourselves; and now that Mrs. Dupont is out of the
  regular teaching harness, she’ll be delighted to help us. She will be in
  a positive ecstasy when she finds that five of ‘her boys’ have undertaken
  a job of this kind. By the way, let us stand up and bow low to Mrs. Dupont—the
  best and most loving teacher that any set of boys ever had or ever will
  have in this world!”</p>
<p>The obeisance to their teacher was made,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> and
  Will’s idea of a “study club” was resolved upon. The idea, as developed,
  was to do much more in a year than the school course marked out, especially
  to help Phil forward to the level of his fellows, and to help Ed repair
  the deficiencies that lay back of his irregular attainments. For Ed was
  now so robust that neither he nor any of his comrades thought of him as
  an invalid. Instead of spending the winter in the South, as he had intended,
  Ed had made up his mind to go back with the others, to join them in their
  “study club,” and to be one of the five when they should enter college.</p>
<p>It was long past midnight when this conversation was over. And the morning
  had active duties for the crew of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> to do.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>
<p class="chaptitle">THE LAST LANDING</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> passed
  the upper part of New Orleans, the boys were disposed to gaze at the strangely
  beautiful city. It was greater in size than any city that they had ever
  seen; for none of them had visited Cincinnati, though they had lived all
  their lives within sixty or seventy miles of it. New Orleans was different
  in architecture, situation, and everything else from Louisville and Memphis,
  cities at which they had looked up from the river, while at New Orleans
  they found themselves looking down, and taking almost a bird’s-eye view
  of the city. Then, too, the palm gardens, the evergreen trees, and glimpses
  every now and then of great parterres of flowers, growing gayly in the
  open air even in late autumn, filled them with the feeling that somehow
  they had come into a world quite different from any they had ever dreamed
  of before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, there were the miles of levee, thickly bordered with steamships
  and sailing craft of every kind, all so new to them as to be a show in
  their eyes. The forests of masts, the towering elevators, the wharves piled
  high with cotton in bales and sugar in hogsheads and great piles of tropical
  fruits, appealed strongly to their imaginations. There was a soft languor
  in the atmosphere, and the red sunlight shone through a sort of Indian
  summer haze, which made the city look dream-like, or as if seen through
  a fleecy, pink veil.</p>
<p>Presently Phil put an end to their musings.</p>
<p>“Stand by the sweeps!” he called, himself going to the steering-oar. “We
  must make a landing, if we ever find a vacant spot at the levee that’s
  big enough to run into.”</p>
<p>“I say, Phil,” said Irv, presently, “there comes somebody in a skiff to
  meet us; perhaps it’s some wharf-master to tell us where to land.”</p>
<p>A few minutes later the skiff, rowed by a stout negro man, reached the
  boat, and a carefully dressed young man who had sat in the stern dismissed
  the negro and his skiff, and came aboard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>
<p>To Phil he handed his card, introducing himself as one of the freight
  clerks of the commission merchant to whom the planter had recommended them.
  It appeared that the planter had not been content with giving them a letter
  of introduction, but had written by mail from Vicksburg, and this was the
  result.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kennedy thought you might have some difficulty in finding the proper
  landing, so he told me to board you and show you the way.”</p>
<p>Phil thanked him, and under the man’s guidance <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> made
  the last of her landings.</p>
<p>The young man seemed to know what to do about everything and how to do
  it. First of all he called an insurance adjuster on board to inspect the
  cargo. This, he explained, was necessary so that all insurance claims might
  be adjusted.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid the flour must be pretty wet,” said Phil.</p>
<p>“Why? is it in bags?” asked the clerk.</p>
<p>“No, in barrels.”</p>
<p>“You can rest easy, then,” said the clerk. “You can’t wet flour in a barrel.
  See there!” and he pointed to a ship that was taking on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> flour
  near by. “That’s flour for Rio Janeiro, and you observe that the crane
  souses every barrel of it into the river before hoisting it to the ship’s
  deck.”</p>
<p>“So it does,” said one of the boys. “But what is that for?”</p>
<p>“To make the flour keep in a hot climate,” answered the clerk. “Wetting
  the barrel closes up all the cracks between the staves, by making a thick
  paste out of the flour that has sifted into them. That makes the barrel
  water-tight, insect-tight, and even air-tight.”</p>
<p>“But I should think the water would soak into the flour inside,” said
  Will.</p>
<p>“Can’t do it. Wouldn’t wet an ounce of flour if you left a barrel in the
  river for a month. Flour is packed too tight for that.”</p>
<p>“I say, Phil,” said Irv. “Let’s go back and get those three barrels we
  left in the river when we were putting the tarpaulin on.”</p>
<p>“Have you a memorandum of your freight, captain?” asked the clerk. “If
  so, please let me have it, and I’ll make out a manifest.”</p>
<p>Phil handed him the little book in which he had catalogued the freight
  as it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span> received.
  Phil had not the slightest idea what a “manifest” might be, but he asked
  no questions. “I prefer to find out some things through my eyes,” he said
  to himself. So he watched the clerk, who spread out some broad sheets of
  paper on the little cabin table and proceeded to make out a formal manifest,
  or detailed statement of the freight on board what the manifest called
  “the good ship <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i>.” It was all arranged in
  columns, and it showed from whom each shipment came, and that each was
  consigned to the house of Mr. Kennedy. Having finished this, the clerk
  proceeded to make out a duplicate, which he explained was to be sent to
  the Exchange, so that an accurate record might be made there for statistical
  purposes.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Phil. “That is the way statistics are got together, showing
  how much of every kind of product is shipped into and out of each commercial
  city.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” answered the clerk, “but, excuse me, here come the reporters.
  Here, boys, make your own manifests,” and with that he handed one of his
  copies to the newspaper men. They scribbled rapidly on paper pads for a
  brief while and then returned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> manifest.
  Phil wondered, but asked no questions. “What these men wrote is for publication
  in newspapers, so I’ll look in the newspapers to-morrow and see what it
  is.” When he did so, he found under the headline “Manifest,” merely a condensed
  list of the boat’s freight with the name of the Kennedy commission house
  as “consignees.” This condensed statement of freights and consignees is
  published daily with reference to every boat that arrives, for the information
  not only of the consignees, but also of other merchants and speculators
  who want to buy, and to that end want to know who has things to sell.</p>
<p>The boys were deeply interested, but their studies in commercial methods
  were destined to be of brief duration. For the clerk left them almost immediately.
  Later in the day he came again and said to Phil:—</p>
<p>“You’re rather in luck, captain. The market for western produce is up
  to-day. Apples were particularly high.”</p>
<p>“Will they stay up long enough for us to work ours off?” asked Phil.</p>
<p>“Work yours off?” exclaimed the clerk, in astonishment. “Why, you’ve sold
  out, bag and baggage, flatboat and all, two hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> ago.
  I came down to make delivery. The buyer’s clerk will be here immediately.”</p>
<p>It was all astonishing to the western boys, but the clerk was good-natured,
  and explained while he waited for the buyer’s clerk. He told them how Mr.
  Kennedy went to a big room called “’change,” where all the other merchants
  were gathered, showed his manifest, and in five minutes had sold out everything.</p>
<p>“But,” said Irv, “nobody has been here to look at the goods. How does
  the buyer know what the things are like?”</p>
<p>“Why, produce is all classified, and we sell by classes. I looked over
  this cargo and reported quality and condition. We made sales accordingly.
  When we deliver, the buyer’s clerk will look at the things, and if any
  of them are not up to the grade represented, he’ll reject them or take
  them at a reduction, and so on. If we can’t agree, the matter will be referred
  to a committee of ’change, and their decision is final. Both sides are
  bound by it.”</p>
<p>“But what if either refused?”</p>
<p>“Well—” hesitated the clerk, “that couldn’t very well happen; but if it
  did, the merchant refusing would have to leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> ’change,
  and go out of business. You see, all business of this kind is done on ’change,
  and if a merchant isn’t a member there, he simply can’t do any business
  at all. But pardon me, here comes the buyer’s clerk. I must get to work.
  Oh, by the way, here’s the card of a comfortable, inexpensive hotel; Mr.
  Kennedy told me to give it to you. He’ll call to see you there.”</p>
<p>“But why can’t we stay on the boat till her buyer is ready to take her
  away?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’ll do that this afternoon. He’ll drop her down to his own warehouse,
  unload her, and by this time to-morrow she’ll be nothing but a pile of
  lumber on shore somewhere.”</p>
<p>“It fairly makes my head swim,” said Irv, “to see the way these city people
  go at things.”</p>
<p>“Mine too,” said Phil. “But I see clearly that that’s the way to get things
  done, and it’s the way we ought to manage in our study club when we get
  home.”</p>
<p>“But how? We can’t have a big ’change and all that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean as to details,” said Phil. “I referred to the spirit of
  the thing. When these people have anything to do, they do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> it
  at once and with all their might. Then they drop that as something done
  for, and without an instant’s delay they turn to something else. That’s
  the way we must manage.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Will Moreraud. “Now that we’re done with the flatboat
  let’s go at once to the hotel. First thing is to pack baggage.”</p>
<p>So they all set about getting their little belongings together.</p>
<p>“What about our blankets, and the stove, and the cooking-utensils and
  the remains of our food supplies, and our water filter, and the fire extinguishers,
  and the tools?” asked Constant Thiebaud, in consternation. “It’ll take
  a day or two to sell them out.”</p>
<p>“Not if we set the right man at it,” said Phil. “I’ll go and see him.”</p>
<p>So he went to the merchant’s clerk, who instantly said:—</p>
<p>“Pile ’em all out on the levee there, and put a card on top saying, ‘For
  sale—inquire on board the flatboat.’ I’ll sell ’em and render you an account.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Phil, “but you’ll accept your commission, of course?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Business is business. We never work for our health on the
  levee.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">RED-LETTER DAYS IN NEW ORLEANS</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> comfortably settled at the little hotel
  near Dryades Street, the boys proceeded to equip themselves for seeing
  the city. They bought a new suit of clothes and a hat apiece, together
  with such underclothes, linen, shoes, and socks as they needed. Indeed,
  they bought more than was necessary for their immediate wants, because
  they would need the clothes on their return home, and they could buy them
  much cheaper in New Orleans than in Vevay. Phil decided to indulge himself
  in an overcoat, the first that he had ever owned, and the others followed
  his example.</p>
<p>“Not that we are likely to need overcoats very pressingly in New Orleans
  at this autumn season,” said Irv, “but I for one have a lively recollection
  of how cold it is in Vevay every winter.”</p>
<p>By appointment they called at the office of Mr. Kennedy, the commission
  merchant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> the
  next day, for a settlement. He furnished them with carefully detailed accounts,
  made out by his bookkeepers, and gave them drafts on New York for the money
  coming to them.</p>
<p>“You’d better send your drafts by mail to your home bank,” he said. “If
  you need any money for your expenses while here, I’ll furnish it, and you
  can remit it from home.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!” responded Phil. “We shan’t need any money for expenses here.
  We’ve enough left of the money we started with, which we call our ‘campaign
  fund,’ for that. But how about our passage home? Do you happen to know,
  sir, about how much that will cost us?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you choose to make it cost you, from nothing at all up,” answered
  the merchant.</p>
<p>A query or two brought out this explanation:—</p>
<p>“You’ve dropped some hints in our conversations”—for he had talked with
  them at their hotel the evening before—“concerning your educational plans,
  and I gather that you want to keep all you can of the money you have made.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>
<p>“Precisely!” said Phil. “Except that we mean to stay here for a week to
  see all we can of the city, we don’t intend to spend a dollar that we can
  save.”</p>
<p>“So I thought,” said the merchant. “I have therefore taken the liberty
  of making some inquiries for you. It happens that I am freighting a steamboat
  with cotton, sugar, molasses, coffee, and fruits, for Louisville. The captain
  is a good friend of mine. As he will have no way-freight,—nothing to put
  on or off till he gets to Louisville, where the stevedores will unload
  the boat,—he has very little for deck hands or roustabouts to do. But there
  will be some ‘wooding up’ to do now and then,—taking on wood for the furnaces,—and
  there will be the decks to keep clean, the lanterns to keep in order, and
  all that sort of thing. Now as you young men are stout fellows and pretty
  well used by this time to roughing it, he has agreed, if you choose, to
  take you instead of the roustabouts and deck hands ordinarily carried.
  There won’t be any wages, but you’ll have your meals from the cook’s galley
  and your passages to Louisville free. Passage from there to Vevay will
  be a trifle, of course.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>The boys were more pleased with the arrangement than they could explain
  in words. But Phil tried to thank Mr. Kennedy, ending by saying, “I don’t
  know why you should take so much trouble for us, sir, as we’re complete
  strangers to you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know why?” asked the merchant, with smiles rippling over his
  face. “Well, let me tell you that the man you rescued from a horrible death
  up there in the Tallahatchie swamp is my brother-in-law, the woman you
  saved is my sister, and the children my nephew and nieces. Now you will
  understand that whatever you happen to want in New Orleans is yours, if
  I know of your wanting it. We should all be more than glad to do vastly
  more for such good friends as you if we could. But my brother-in-law writes
  me that he talked with you about that, and concluded that boys of your
  sort are likely to do much better for themselves than anybody can do for
  them. Now, not a word more on that subject, please,” as Ed, with his big
  eyes full of tears, arose, intending to say something of his own and his
  comrades’ feelings. “Not a word more. Besides, there’s a clerk waiting
  for me at the door. Go to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> opera
  to-night, and hear some good music. One of my clerks will leave tickets
  at the hotel for you. And be ready at noon to-morrow for a drive. I’ll
  call for you, and show you our town. Good-by now, good-by—really, I mustn’t
  talk longer. Good-by.”</p>
<p>And so the overwhelmed youngsters found themselves bowed out into Camp
  Street without a chance to say a word of thanks.</p>
<p>The next day, in two open carriages, Mr. Kennedy drove the boys for hours
  over the beautiful and picturesque old city—up into the Carrollton district,
  where are fine residences and broad streets; down through the French Creole
  region, where the quaintness of the city is something wholly unmatched
  in any other town in America; and out over a beautiful road to Lake Pontchartrain,
  with luncheon at the Halfway House.</p>
<p>“This will be enough for to-day,” said their host, as they rose from their
  meal. “To-morrow morning, if you young gentlemen like, we’ll drive down
  to the battlefield, where Jackson won his famous victory and saved the
  Mississippi River and all the region west of it from British control. We’ll
  drive into the city now, and you would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> do
  well to rest this afternoon, for driving in this crisp autumn air makes
  one tired and sleepy.”</p>
<p>The boys protested that he was unwarrantably taking his time for their
  entertainment, but he had a way of turning off such things with a laugh
  which left nothing else to be said.</p>
<p>So the trip to the battlefield was made, but this time they had a second
  companion in the person of a young professor from Tulane University, whom
  Mr. Kennedy had pressed into service to explain the battlefield and all
  the events connected with it.</p>
<p>On the following day Mr. Kennedy took his young friends down the river
  on a little steamer, on board which they passed a night and two days, seeing
  the forts and hearing from the professor the story of the part they had
  played in Farragut’s celebrated river fight, and visiting the jetties—those
  stupendous engineering works by which the government deepened the mouth
  of the river so as to permit large ships to come up to the city.</p>
<p>On the way back from this two days’ trip Mr. Kennedy invited the boys
  to dine with him at his home on the next evening. With a queer smile upon
  his lips, he said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>
<p>“I ought to have asked you to my house sooner, perhaps, but I wasn’t ready.
  There were some little details that I wanted to arrange first.”</p>
<p>When the dinner evening came, the boys entered the stately mansion with
  more of embarrassment than they would have cared to confess. It was the
  finest house they had ever seen,—a stately, old-fashioned structure, with
  broad galleries running around three of its sides, and with a spacious
  colonnade in front. It stood in the midst of a garden of palm, ilex, and
  magnolia trees, occupying an entire city block, and shut in by a high brick
  wall, pierced by great gateways and little ones.</p>
<p>Inside, the house was luxuriously comfortable, filled with old-fashioned
  furniture, time-dulled pictures, and here and there a bit of statuary,
  but with none of that painfully breakable looking bric-a-brac that one
  finds so often and in such annoying profusion in the houses of the rich
  or the well-to-do. There was nothing here that meant show, nothing that
  did not suggest easy use and comfort.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy himself followed the servant to the door to receive his young
  friends.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> When
  he had ushered them into a homelike, “back-parlor” sort of a room, he excused
  himself for a brief time and left them. About a minute later they heard
  little feet pattering down the great hall, and, an instant later, “Baby”
  toddled in. She paused a moment, and then rushing into Phil’s arms called
  aloud:—</p>
<p>“My boys! My big boys!” Then she raised her little voice, and cried:—-</p>
<p>“Come, papa! Come, mamma! My boys is come!”</p>
<p>This was the “little detail” that Mr. Kennedy had waited to arrange. He
  had induced his sister and her husband to bring the children to New Orleans,
  to await the flood’s subsidence; and he had waited for their arrival before
  inviting the boys to dinner, in order that their welcome might be eager,
  and their enjoyment of his hospitality free from embarrassment.</p>
<p>In company with their flatboat guests, the lads felt completely at home,
  and perhaps their shrewdly kind host aided toward this result by having
  the dinner served in the most homelike and informal way that he could manage.</p>
<p>As the steamboat on which they were to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> “work
  their way” up the river was to sail the next afternoon, this evening at
  Mr. Kennedy’s was their last in New Orleans.</p>
<p>“And what a delightful finish it has been to all our experiences!” said
  Irv, when they all got back to their hotel.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">“IT”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is not much more of this story for me
  to tell. The voyage up the river involved very little of work, and nothing
  at all of adventure. The steamboat was a slow one. She plodded along, day
  and night, never landing except when it was necessary to take on fifty
  cords or so of wood, with which to make steam.</p>
<p>Phil and his comrades took pride in keeping the decks in most scrupulously
  clean condition, and doing with earnest care the other tasks—mostly very
  small ones—which fell to their lot.</p>
<p>It took about nine days for the pottering old freight steamer to make
  the journey to Louisville; for although the great flood had considerably
  subsided, the Ohio was still sufficiently full for the boat to pass over
  the falls and land her cargo at the city, instead of discharging it at
  Portland, four miles below.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>
<p>Bidding farewell to their captain, the crew of <i>The Last of the Flatboats</i> donned
  their new clothes, and took passage for Vevay on the mail boat.</p>
<p>They landed at their home town late in the afternoon, hired a drayman
  to haul their small baggage to their several homes, and proudly marched
  up Ferry Street like the returning adventurers that they were, while all
  the small boys in town trudged along with them precisely as they would
  have followed a circus parade.</p>
<p>After briefly visiting their homes and having reunion suppers there with
  their families, the boys reassembled in their old meeting-place, Will Moreraud’s
  room over a store. There they made out all their accounts, trying hard
  to make them look like those prepared by Mr. Kennedy’s bookkeepers in New
  Orleans. They were then ready to settle, on the next day, with all the
  owners of the cargo they had carried.</p>
<p>When all was arranged, Phil figured a while, and then said:—</p>
<p>“Fellows, we’ve netted a profit of exactly four hundred and fifty dollars
  clear, by our trip. That’s ninety dollars apiece to add to our college
  fund. The money’s in bank to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> my
  credit. I’ll draw a check for each fellow’s share.”</p>
<p>When he had delivered to each of his comrades a check for ninety dollars,
  he rose and stretched himself and said, with accents of relief:—</p>
<p>“Now I’m not ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>’ any longer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, you are,” said Irv. “We fellows are going to stick together
  now, you know. There’s the study club, you remember. That will need an
  ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’ and you’ll be the ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’
  won’t he, boys?”</p>
<p>“You bet!” said all in a breath.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>When Irv and Ed reported the voyage and the study club plan to Mrs. Dupont,
  she entered enthusiastically into the scheme.</p>
<p>“Don’t go to school at all this year,” she said. “Come to me instead.
  When bright boys have made up their minds to study as hard as they can
  without any forcing, all they need is a tutor to help them when they need
  help. I’ll be the tutor. The old schoolroom in my house, where I taught
  you boys and your fathers the multiplication table long before graded schools
  were thought of in this town, is unoccupied. Everything in it is just as
  it was when you boys were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">[382]</a></span> with
  me. I’ll have the maids dust it up, and it shall be the home of the ‘Study
  Club.’”</p>
<p>When the boys told the wise old lady how Phil had been made “<span class="smcap">It</span>”
  on the voyage, and how splendidly he had risen to his responsibilities,
  she smiled, but showed no surprise.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you boys had the good sense to choose Phil for your leader,”
  she said. “If you had asked me, I should have told you to do just that.
  I am older than you by nearly half a century. I have taught several generations
  of boys, and I think I know boys better than I know anything else in the
  world. Now let me tell you about Phil. He was born to be ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’
  he will always be ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>,’ though he will never
  try to be. He has a gift—if I didn’t detest the word for the bad uses it
  has been put to, I’d say he has a ‘mission’ to be ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>’
  in every endeavor that he may be associated with. Whenever you’re in doubt,
  be very sure that Phil is your best ‘<span class="smcap">It</span>.’”</p>
